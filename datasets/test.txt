{"words": "Absolutely gorgeous. Though the Kings of Convenience's first album is not \"electronic\" in the strictest sense (or in any sense), there's still no denying the utter beauty of this album. The first track on the album, \"Winning a Battle, Losing the War,\" is my favorite, full of shimmering guitars and pensive lyrics; the track doesn't explodes as much as it blossoms right at the end. \"Singing Softly to Me\" throws in some trumpet to emphasize the call-and-response of the song, while \"I Don't Know What I Can Save You From\" adds a mournful cello towards the end, as if underlining the futility of the situation. The haunting melodies and the powerful lyrics get under your skin and stick in your head. An underlying melancholy lies at the heart of some of the outstanding tracks like \"The Weight of My Words,\" \"Little Kids,\" and the powerful closing tracks, \"The Passenger\" and \"Parallel Lines.\" The album titles says it all: QUIET IS THE NEW LOUD.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Though \"Quiet Is The New Loud\" lacks a hit like \"I'd Rather Dance With You\" from their newest album \"Riot On An Empty Street\", every song here is wonderfully mellow and good enough to make it a better album overall (that one had some bad tracks). Erlend Oye was clearly blessed with one of the most soothing voices in the music business. Not only are the vocals great, but the lyrics are also very interesting, even if they lack catchiness. That's not really what this album's about anyway; it's about relaxing. The instrumentation is also pretty simple - it's basically just acoustic guitars and drums, but they're wonderful here - they perfectly encapsulate the mood. \"Failure\" and \"I Don't Know What I Can Save You From\" may be the standout tracks, but, really, they're all wonderful. They may not be breaking any new ground here, but they don't really have to - you're going to love it anyway. Practically any music fan will love this, and for that it definitely earns \"5\" stars. You'll never get tired of listening to this! This is highly recommended!\n\nHighlights include:\nthe entire album!", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I first had a chance to listen to Kings' \"Riot on an Empty Street\" and found it to be much more elaborate from a stand point of harmonies, composition and lyrics. Well into \"Quiet is the New Loud\", though it's not a BAD album, it doesn't quite catch you either and it even ends up being a  bit boring at times. I recommend you check out the band's 2004 album instead. Pass on this one.", "label": "bad review"}

Artists and bands like Badly Drawn Boy, Coldplay, Turin Brakes, and Travis are embracing folk music and incorporating it with pop and rock. Kings of Convience is the next band to come out with a cd filled with melodic folk/rock. A lot of reviewers has compared this band with the late artist Nick Drake which I can totally hear through out the entire cd.\nTo be perfectly honest, I really don't know what to make of this album so far. I have only listened to it twice. Compared to Turin Brakes, I much prefer Turin Brakes over Kings of Convience. I found this cd a bit too mellow for my tastes. Even Travis rocks out on a few songs on their latest album. Perhaps I just need to listen to \"Quiet is the New Loud\" a few more times to enjoy it more.", "label": "bad review"}

She had showcased a brilliant and beautiful bravado of songs that really have with stood the test of time, on her own and healing through the soul of jazz and R&B soul overall. When I have thought of Natalie Cole, I think of her deepest songs that really showed all sides from pop and R&B like Snowfall In The Sahara, Live For Your Love and the dearest ballad of them all, Unforgettable. The song which Nat King Cole recorded on his own was one thing, but when Natalie did it in 1991, it really became timeless beyond what words could ever expect. It is just one of those duets that really drives you at the heartstrings so deep, you'll forget what cheap music of today really is.

He work as a amazing songstress has been delivered through the heartache, and from the soul of following in the footsteps of her beloved father, the great Nat King Cole. I am definitely crushed as a hard core fan of Natalie's. Her voice defiinitely ranged from the sassy in soul and R&B, to the sophisticated Jazz intimacy of her beloved father's legacy. While she had her demons from drug abuse, and the heartbreaks of three failed marriages, what Ms. Cole did for a lifetime, was truly beyond breathtaking at soul. Obviously her biggest hit was really with her beloved father, Unforgettable. The song really showed a beauty and closeness to what Natalie had never experienced with Nat King Coke, and his heartbreaking death. Now with Ms. Cole passing on, the song is so surreal at the soul. I am just shedding tears of sadness for her. Natalie Cole was truly unforgettable.\n\nNatalie Cole  1950-2015\n\nSong: A", "label": "good review"}

Our library's check out time can be anywhere from 3 to 7 days and as long as no one got in behind you to reserve your book, you can just re-check it out.\n===\n[Note that these last 2 items are not necessary if you only plan to use B&Noble...and don't forget they often offer free content too, as well as samplers!]\n...\nNow just a few things...the Nook First Edition lets you more dynamically play with fonts whereas this one has preset font size options but that's still quite alright..but > this < one lets you highlight a word and it has a dictionary right there for you !\nWell, if you're of the mindset that you don't quite want to give up the tactile experience of a physical book, I'm telling you that you will quickly overcome that.

{"words": "So I really like eInk readers to read on.  We have tablets for pretty much every person in the family in multiple sizes... still, I prefer to read on a eInk reader.  I've owned a Kindle 2, and 3, & a Nook Classic, so this is my fourth eInk reader though I have had a grey scale reader, Libre Pro, which is similar in that it has no backlight but the contrast just doesn't compare.  Still even that is easier on the eyes for long length reading than the tablets.\n\nSo I wanted a eInk that I could read at night, with as little light as possible to not disturb, without a reading light.  I had been looking at the Glow and then the Paperwhite for a while and finally decided to buy the Kindle.  Most reviews has it as the winner.  CNET was very close but Kindle still won for mainly versatility in products and screen.  So ordered the Paperwhite for me and a friend, we would order a second if both of us liked it.  She tried it out first and said that it just wasn't responsive enough, didn't turn pages fast enough, and everything took too long.  I think that the actually product was faulty there though because going to setting was like being on dial up Internet, slow as sin.  Still, I would have sent it back for a replacement except that when I got it and used it for about a week (I didn't have page turning issues as I don't read as fast), I found that reading it at night was NOT what I hoped for.  First it had four prominent half moon dark spots at the bottom of the screen.  I might have been able to get over that just as I have the light bleed at the top of the Nook Glow, except that the screen throughout is not uniformly lighted, especially at the lowest settings.  Since I am using this in a completely dark room, I only care about the lowest settings.  The non-uniformity of the screen was the breaking point.  I never got used to it.\n\nSo I returned the Paperwhite, my friend decided to go for a tablet (Nook HD+ because of the responsiveness of tablets and the size, not my preference) and I decided to try out the Glow.  I've heard there are problems with bleed through pin pricks of light from damage on the very sensitive screen.  They now come with screen protectors already installed and I am hoping it protects from that.  Still I figured for the sale price I could use it as a eInk reader without the light if that does occur in the future.\n\nWhat I like about the Glow\n- page back and page forward buttons on bezel on both sides of the screen.  Paperwhite does not have this.\n- very low light setting.  Paperwhite again doesn't have this.  Many reviews actually state the paperwhites brightness to be a selling point, why?  I'm reading it in the dark so want a low light.\n- the lighting is even along the screen where you are actually reading, yes there is a light at the top of the screen but it is not distracting, less so than a clip on light by far.\n- Easy to use interface.\n- Actual home button at the bottom middle of the screen to wake up reader and hold to toggle the glow light off and on.  Fewer step to adjust the lighting than the paperwhite.\n- Glow light turns off... completely. Paperwhite is always on.  In a low light room, I'm OK with no Glow and Paperwhite's uneven lighting was poor for me in low light settings unless I turned it bright.\n- I found it slightly more comfortable to hold than the Paperwhite, it is lighter but I don't think that was it as it is pretty inconsequential.  I think it was the shape.\n- SD expansion slot to up to 32GB more.\n- Price\n\nWhat is not so great\n- back and forward buttons are a little tiring to fingers after a while, so left hand holding is only comfortable for a while.  Right hand can always tap gently on the screen instead of the button. Kindle 3 and 4 have easy buttons to push.\n- Only 250MB of internal storage for side loaded content, another 1GB for Nook books and content, though there is a micro SD expansion.  So both Paperwhite and Glow have 2GB but a bit is used for operating system and then the Nook takes most of what is left over for B&N content.  I found that 4GB of Kindle 3 was just right for me and the 2GB Kindle 2 and Paperwhite was lacking as once they get too full they start lagging.  Why they downgraded the Paperwhite, Touch and Kindle 4??\n- Side loaded content has to be side unloaded also. No deletion method from the Glo directly.  Nook books you can double tap and archive and they are taken off your Glo, not deleted from you library.\n- Power button on back gets covered by cases.  I end up not putting the Glo in standby but just wait for it to go off by itself.\n\nSo overall I am really happy with my Glow.  My Nook Classic stopped charging, the charging port died, after 3 years.  My Kindle 2 still works but I gave it away to a friend.  My Kindle 3 is still my favorite eInk reader of all time, the Glow is a quick 2nd mainly because of size and light.  If the light every stops working correctly, I'll use it as a non-lighted eInk reader and still be happy as I paid 1/2 the price of a Paperwhite, the same price as a Kindle 4, and no ads, and comes with a charger.  A month in and I'm very happy.  Got a Squaretrade warranty as just in case though.\n\nEdit and added ---\nI recently got another Paperwhite while on sale as I kept hearing great things and wanted a second eInk night reader.  One of my friends checked her low light setting on a 2nd Generation. They fixed the issue of the splotchy lighting and the low light setting is lower than the Nook's.  Other than the side buttons, which I love on my Nook, it is the better device now, that is the 2nd Generation Paperwhite.  Slightly sharper, slightly smaller, bigger memory without a card, brighter and dimmer light settings.  Still I think the first generation should be avoided.\n\nSo another edit---\nWe got a 3rd gen Paperwhite with the same resolution of the Voyage. I actually don't notice the difference from the 2nd gen. It is slightly nicer than the Nook. I still read on my Nook frequently as I might have two books going and just read one on one and the other on the other. I hated the ads on the Paperwhite so ended up paying the $30 to get rid of them so even on sale it cost $130 in the end. So the really issue is... is it worth the price difference. $70 vs $130 (or $150 vs $100 when not on sale) They both work for library books.", "label": "good review"}

I have a lot of Nook books which I have been reading on the Ipad Mini but I do a lot of my reading at night and the backlight is too harsh for my eyes after working at a computer all day.  I finally decided to take the chance and purchased the Nook Glowlight.  I've had it for three weeks now and so far so good - though there is a little tiny pin hole on the screen.  I had asked the customer service person at BN about the problem and she said it was just a bad batch early on and the problem was fixed.  We'll see.  I did purchase the extended warranty just in case and figured if the screen does fail I'll just give up and use a clip on light.  I like the Nook.  I like the size, the feel and the page turn buttons.  I really hope this device holds up.  It deserves to have a good following - but BN needs to step up and commit to solving whatever is wrong.

{"words": "Need I say more?  Ok I will: The price is right.  If your primary goal is READING ACTUAL WORDS (What a thought!!!) then this e-reader is an excellent choice.

{"words": "I feel bad saying I hate this product because when I first received it I absolutely loved it.  The quality of the GlowLight when used was spectacular, the features where easy to use.  Then tiny \"cracks / lines\" started to appear in the screen / light which made it difficult to use at first; then as more appeared the device became completely unusable.  This device was not abused in anyway. It was kept in a case, not dropped, etc..  After further searching concerning this problem, it is not uncommon.  A significant number of people reported the same problem even though their care of the device was good.  The most disturbing part of all this is that the manufacturer of the product has known about this problem and to date the item is still being sold with the defect.  I was so disappointed because other than this problem I loved my NOOK Simple Touch with GlowLight.  I now have a Kindle Paperwhite, it is similar to the Nook but just enough difference that except for the defect I like the Nook by a slight margin but not enough to invest in a defective product again.  In addition, there is difference between customer service for both devices. The Nook customer service regarding defects / returns / replacements is poor compared to the good reports of customer service with the Kindle.  Wanted to like the NOOK Simple Touch but couldn't risk it.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Many moons ago I bought my first Ebook reader, it was a \"Rocket Book\"!  I must have read hundreds of books on that little device.  It was just about perfect.  Small and light enough (size of a paperback, weight of a hardback) that I could hold it one hand, easy thumb controls, had a backlight for nighttime reading, I could read the screen in daylight (most of the time) and it stored a bunch of books.  Heck, it even had a stylus for lookup and markup.  The day the battery no longer held a charge a small part of me died with it...\n\nSo, the day the iPads came out I quickly adopted them as my go to E-reader. Great devices and they do many things well but they aren't really conducive to being E-readers.  Don't get me wrong, I've read many, many books on my iPads but they've always been just a bit clumsy.  Too big, too heavy, and there's never been a comfortable thumb control for me while holding it. I'm sure the newer and smaller iPad would go a great way to solving some of those problems but all iPads are still basically creatures of the night.  Besides draining my wallet they tend to shrink from the sunshine.  I'll never ditch my iPad but i really, REALLY wanted my old E-reader back.  I didn't want something what would flash the home team's score, an Email telling me my spam filter is less than effective or someone messaging me a picture of their meal all the while I'm trying to immerse myself in one my favorite author's far flung fantasies.  I JUST WANT TO READ A DARN BOOK IN PEACE!  So for a while, GASP, I went back to \"real\" books.  I know, I was weak and no matter how many times I punched that unknown word with my stylus those stupid BOOKS wouldn't bring up a single dictionary.\n\nI've seen E-Ink products for a while.  I remember when the technology was first introduced and how it was going to revolutionize the world. Yeah, whatever.  E-Ink and a perpetual motion machine and we'd be all set.  I think it was Sony that first introduced a viable product.  Good but those screens - egads!  Well, let me say that times have changed.  The current crop of E-ink technology is pretty amazing.  Not perfect but amazing non the less.  I was able to put my hands on the Nook and was very much impressed.  first off, it's light, VERY light.  The E-Ink looks great and the backlight is perfect.  Lots of little features pushed me over the edge such as WiFi for purchases and downloads and a touch screen for a myriad of uses.  As soon as I had my own Nook in hand I down three books on my list.  Wow, it was great!  It goes everywhere with me and when I'm reading, I'M READING.  No distractions.  If I want distractions I'll leave my phone close by.  It really is an amazing device that harkens back to my original Rocket E-book reader - but better.  I love being able to change pages by just touching the side of the screen.  Battery life is amazing assuming I'm not leaving the backlight on all the time and even then it's not too shabby.  I find sometimes I like to turn on the backlight even during the day instead of turning on a lamp.\n\nI gave the Nook 5 stars because it really does everything that it claims to do.  It's a great E-book reader and the cost is pretty cheap imho.  I'm very happy with my purchase and I would absolutely recommend this device to anyone who's interested in mono purpose device.\n\nGripes, very few and very minor.  The device has four raised marks on its face.  Two on the left and two on the right.  They're buttons for page forward and reverse and can be switch in software as to which set goes forward such and so forth.  I don't use them as I have a hard time pressing them.  I find that if you don't press these lines dead center you aren't pressing the button underneath and there's no tactile feedback that you're on the center of the line.  Perhaps a little dimple or such, similar to the home keys on a keyboard, might help.  Even dead center I find the buttons require a bit more \"push\" than I find easy to do without thinking.  As i said previously, I find it much easier to simply swipe or tap the screen to advance the pages.  Which leads me to touching or swiping the screen.  Sometimes it works a little too well.  When I'm reading a book and have my thumb close to the screen in anticipation of changing the page it will sometimes trigger the page turn without ever actually touching the screen.  Unless it's developed ESP I think it's a just a tad too sensitive.  Also, when I do actually touch the screen, on rare occasions, it will double advance or triple advance the page.  Screen refreshes are much better than 1st gen devices but in bright light there's still a slight ghosting.  They mitigate that by performing a full screen flash every four page turns.  You'll notice the whole screen turn black very quickly before the text returns.  Again, no issues in normal light and I can only see ghosting in very bright direct sunshine.  The only other issue worth mentioning is the Micro SD slot.  I've read that many people have had problems with this slot not holding the memory cards, it tends not to \"lock\" them into place.  I had that same problem and was about to replace the device when it just started working.  Perhaps I wasn't pushing the SD deep enough into the slot as it has to go flush with the opening before it clicks now.  It also gave me some guff in recognizing the card but after a reboot (not just powering off) everything was again hunky dory.\n\nAll said and done I find it a delightful little device and I look forward to reading many more books with it.  Hopefully its long term test drive will match its short term success.", "label": "good review"}

There is nothing I would not change. They completely overlooked the structure and software of this product with a sole emphasis on book sales. Sad. The touch screen barely works, usually takes multiple taps/swipes for it to even recognize that you are trying to do something and then who knows what it will actually do.

{"words": "I have changed my review of this product from 5 stars to 0 stars. I was in love with this thing at one point in time. However, it has a horrible defect that I just cannot live with. If you sideload your books (add your own books to a memory card instead of purchasing from Barnes and Noble), everytime you turn the device completely off and on (like in the event of it freezing, like mine's has done more than once) all of your shelves (like collections on Kindle) will erase. Disappear, your shelves are empty. It also happens if you disconnect your Nook from your Macbook the wrong way.\n\nAs a person with around 800 sideloaded books, this is completely unacceptable. I need the organization. As a girl with Aspergers Syndrome, I REALLY need the organization. I even contacted Barnes and Noble's customer service online, but their reply was practically calling me a liar. \"Thanks for contacting us....Shelves only erase if you reset the Nook or deregister the device....Thank you, Goodbye!\" Really, how are you going to ignore a problem that I can replicate on demand?! A quick Google search will show that I am not the only one, and others are having the exact same issue.\n\nSo to recap, Barnes and Noble only gives you 250mb (yes, that's megabytes) of storage on the device for your own books. The rest of the space is reserved for Barnes and Noble purchases. I was okay with this because you can add your own MicroSD card up to 32GB (WAY overkill for books lol) for storage. But Barnes and Noble has gimped this feature with this horrible glitch and refuses to fix it or even acknowledge that it even exists! It seems to me that they have found another way to force you to buy books from them instead of other sources. Isn't that a little sneaky?!\n\nBarnes and Noble has horrible customer service, so if you are used to Amazon's amazing service stay away from this company. It is (or was) my favorite bookstore and I used to visit and purchase items weekly (it smells wonderful in there!). I should have frequented Borders more, so they wouldn't have gone out of business here in the South. (Yes, I'm saying I have the purchasing power to save a whole franchise. Just joking :-) It's no wonder Barnes and Nobles are closing all around me, shouldn't you try to please the customer and not call them a liar, so they'll come back?

I am 98% happy with it- it loses a point for occasionally going back to the screensaver when I press the Glowlight button, and one point for occasional ghosting in extremely bright sunlight.  Both complaints are trivial, as the Nook's good points far outweigh the bad.\nThe Glowlight is awesome!  Clean, even lighting across the screen and it's easily adjustable.  The lookup function for word definitions is very handy, battery life is phenomenal, memory/storage is generous, and it's very easy to navigate the B&N website for new books.

Your gonna have about three gbs of memory left, but you'll have even more storage with a memory card (microSDHC). The screen display is is very crisp! I mainly use this tablet to read books, browse the internet, listen to music and watch movies, so I'll just touch on those things.\n\nChrome browser loads faster than the regular browser. The reader is great. I downloaded PDFs and books from the kindle and nook store. There weren't any issues. The services I used are Spotify and Prime Music apps. Spotify locked up maybe twice so far, which isn't a deal. And Prime music is good, but the artwork is really blurry for some reason. Its not a big deal either. They are both good for listening to music. TuneIn Radio worked well.\n\nFor movies I used Netflix. I didn't have any issues with the app. The navigation was easy and videos played smoothly. As far as other apps, theres plenty to choose from. The tablet comes with Google app store and the Samsung app store. Battery life was perfect. I thought it would the battery would die out fast since I use the tablet, but it didn't. There's also a power save option that you could use. It changes the tablet settings to make the battery last even longer. One small issue that bothered me is the notification alert. Its a annoying whistle sound. Minor flaws aside, this is a very good tablet. One more thing, I'll update this review as I test out more of the features.\n\nUpdate. I forgot to add in my review that kindle books do work on here. I was reading books on the Kindle app. I took some screenshots of the features that I used, but for some weird reason its not letting me add photos to the \"customer image\" section or into my review. I'm not sure if its a glitch on Amazon or something, but I will check into it. Look out for another update.", "label": "good review"}

His tale intertwines with that of Ding Ming, an \"indentured servant\" of sorts.

{"words": "This fast moving story takes place over a couple of days in and around Leeds, England.  Two parallel stories intertwine and collide.  Inspector Jian, a rough and ready, old school Chinese policeman has come to England to find his daughter, a rebellious college student, who has left him an alarming message.  Fearing the worst, Jian is trying to track her down.  Seemingly impervious to his total lack of English language schools, he pushes, cajoles, bullies, or threatens anyone who might help him on his quest.  At the same time, Ding Ming is a newly arrived illegal immigrant with his wife, Little Ye.  He doesn't realize how horribly he is being exploited, and what \"services\" the smugglers have in mind for Little Ye and the other young women.  Ming and Jian's stories come together like a bad car crash, halfway through the book.  Then, they go careening around as Jian forces Ming, who has passable English skills, to help him out on his search for his daughter.  The twists and turns of the road they drive on match the twist and turns of the plot.  Simon Lewis keeps you on the seat of your pants, trying to guess what the next complication will be, and who will die this time.", "label": "good review"}

One as someone who has made numerous trips to Asia and teaches about Asian history and culture, I thought this book was spot on about China and the Chinese today.  Also, as someone with many friends and family members in the Chinese immigrant community in New York I thought this book was quite open and honest as to what goes on there.  Though the setting is England, I am sure there are many many things alike.\n\nSimon Lewis clearly understands China and Chinese people and also knows what is going on in the immigrant communities.  Very often in the US, were think about immigration we think about people from Mexico and Latin America.  We do not think about the cook at the takeout, or the girl bringing you your sushi, or how the person doing your nails got here.  THis book reminds us that immigration and immigration issues go beyond Mexico and Latin America.\n\nJian is quite an interesting character and gives the reader a very different perspective on things.\n\nThis is a great book and I highly recommend it.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I'm a fan of the exotic. I like to be surprised, to be kept off balance by strange and different things. I really enjoy John Burdett's \"Bangkok\" series and this bore some similarities, so I gave it a shot. I wasn't disappointed.\n\nI can't say I particularly liked the protagonist, Inspector Jian, but that's not really necessary. As a father, I  could identify with (and support) his mission, if not always the difficulties he faced trying to accomplish it. Author Lewis's writing is straightforward; he very effectively conveys the frustration of being in a very foreign place with nowhere to turn and no one to turn to. The supporting cast of characters is memorable, each in their own way; thankfully Lewis doesn't turn his villains into caricatures.\n\nDespite a feeling of \"bigness\" or sprawl, the environment of the story is remarkably small. The idea of circularity (that is, of going around in circles) is a recurring theme, for the long-suffering illegal immigrant Ding Ming in particular: no matter where he goes, or how beat-up he gets trying to get there, he always seems to end up right back where he started. But for him, that's eventually a good thing.\n\nThe setup and climax are relatively compact; it's the trip in the middle that takes up the bulk of the story. And I think that may be the point: as they say, it's not the destination; it's the journey. Enjoy the ride.", "label": "good review"}

You also learn quite a few interesting things about life as lived in China.\n\nMy only gripe was the incredible number of beatings the guy took, and each time it seemed he was almost dead, but came back fighting.. a little unbelievable, but the rest was solid.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "The author's idea of writing a thriller in which the main characters do not speak / have trouble with the language of the place where the action develops is interesting. Especially when considering the tools used to convey this factor: a combination of broken English sentences, even when referring to some of the descriptions, and a need for translation help by other characters. This in turn leads to some funny situations but also to some frustrating ones.\n\nThat said, it is clear that some readers will find the style more annoying than rewarding. In my case, there were a couple of instances in which I started to get a little frustrated (this is the main reason why I took away a star) but luckily, the story has several good traits that allowed me to pull out of this state pretty quickly.\n\nThose readers that enjoy fast-paced thrillers, with a combination of mystery, suspense and action will be right at home with this novel. The plot is not overly complex, and some of the surprises are not that hard to anticipate, but the experience is definitely enjoyable. Human trafficking is not a novel topic, but in this book the author uses a particular perspective to make it \"taste fresh\". Also, the two main characters, a Chinese inspector looking for her daughter and a hopeful peasant coming illegally into the UK, present a nice set of contrasts, which I found helped the story quite a bit.\n\nAs mentioned, the only potential drawback has to do with the writing style. However, I am confident that most people will like it or at least be OK with it, and therefore will have a very good time with Lewis' work.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "with all due respect to the author, this was one of those books that i desperately wanted to like, but found myself continually frustrated with. to me it's one of those books that tries too hard to be important, gritty and 'hip.'  those are all noble ambitions, i guess, but it's difficult to pull off without coming across as haughty and pretentious, which 'bad traffic,' unfortunately, struck me as being.\n\nwhile the plot was at times interesting [it has all the predictable elements of 'gritty' noir fiction], there were too many expository diversions [as others have noted] that slowed the pacing down to a crawl. it felt like not a whole lot happened during the first 200 pages, and what did happen was either incredible vulgar [probably the point and probably meant to 'shock' the reader with its 'brutal honesty'] or did little to ingratiate any of the characters to the reader.  however, what was most frustrating for me was the author continually injecting chinese into the dialogue [or exposition] then immediately translating it into english when the characters are presumably speaking chinese to begin with.  it's the same problem that plagued 'the kite runner.' it drives me nuts. it seems the only reason for this practice is for the author to dazzle the reader with his or her knowledge of a foreign language. whether it's fair or not, i had hard time getting past that and consequently enjoyed the book less than i might have otherwise.\n\ni freely and fully admit this really isn't my kind of book and that probably shades my overall opinion; but if you like bloody and vulgar crime books where nothing much happens most of the time, this is probably for you.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Bad Traffic is a kind of modern-day noir thriller:  instead of set in 1950s Los Angeles, though, it's set in present-day Britain.  Instead of featuring hard-boiled private eyes and gangster dames, it features a tough Chinese police officer who comes to Britain to investigate his daughter's disappearance.  He's thrust into a world of illegal immigrants, Chinese gangsters and the restaurant industry, where he doesn't speak the language, is running out of money, and can't figure out what has really happened to his daughter.  Inspector Jian ends up with an illegal immigrant named Ding Ming as his hapless sidekick; Ding Ming speaks English and serves as translator and mapreader while Jian follows the trail left by his daughter.\n\nThis was suspenseful and compelling; Inspector Jian is a truly original character, commenting on Chinese and British cultural mores, facing his own inadequacies as a father, and still plugging away at finishing the job he set out to do.  I'm looking foward to seeing more from Simon Lewis.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "While it is certainly the case that one doesn't have to be a member of the ethnic/cultural/racial group that one is writing about to do a good job of writing about the particular group (Tony Hillerman's novels are, I think, a good example of this), I think it certainly helps.  Granted we are talking about a work of fiction her, but really all works of fiction have an element of truth to them...at least the good ones do. Having said that the writer of this novel isn't Chinese (although it sounds like he has spent a lot of time immersed in Chinese culture), but his characters are and a lot of the novel is a description of the Chinese characters reactions to Western Society/Culture.  This being the case, I was scratching my head throughout the novel wondering if this would indeed be their reactions and am I learning anything about the clash between East and West reading this novel.  Granted, as I said before this is a work of fiction, nonetheless, I think it overall if detracted from the impact of the novel (I would expect this is a point that many would disagree with me on).  Having said that, as far as mystery/thrillers/crime novels go, this was a good read.  Oddly enough I found the most interesting character in the book not to be the protagonist Ma Jian, but Ding Ming.  And while the Inspectors plight to find his daughter is certainly an agonizing one, I think it pails in comparison to that of Ding Ming's.  Overall, I think that this is indeed where the novel really succeeds--i.e., in it's portrayal of the plight of illegal immigrants, be they Chinese of otherwise, and the truly awful circumstances they find themselves in search of a better life.  The authors description of the human trafficking is a truly disturbing one; one which gives us a better understanding of the exploitation of illegal immigrants and the perhaps the role we all play in its existence. In that regard, I give the novel 5 stars.", "label": "bad review"}

I'm a little bit leery of these skewed representations of how bad things are in other countries, but I loved that they made this totally corrupt inspector so smart as well.

{"words": "Bad Traffic is a story that centers on Inspector Ma Jian, a high-powered policeman in China who is on a mission to rescue his daughter who is a studying in the UK after receiving a mysterious call for help from her.  Along the way, his story intersects with that of Ding Ming, a mild-mannered, poor migrant whose ability to speak some English helps Inspector Jian navigate the landscape.\n\nI thought I had the book figured out at the beginning of the book.  Certainly, I figured very early that human trafficking was somehow involved.  Imagine my pleasant surprise to be gripped by plot twists and turns and to be totally riveted for the entirety of the story's concluding chapters.  For a reader who reads many mystery novels, Bad Traffic was able to maintain a high level of suspense throughout its pages and deliver its shockers without giving away too much in the beginning of the book.  As such, it was a pretty well crafted story.\n\nLewis does a fabulous job of generating authenticity with his character's mannerisms, speech, and personalities with regard to their Chinese ethnicity and especially when it comes to the description of an individual set loose in a strange place, no common language, and entirely different cultures.  I imagine that Lewis drew upon his own experience as a traveler in China and Japan (Lewis is also the author of the Rough Guides to China, Beijing, and Shanghai), it is particularly a talent that he can scrutinize his own native land of the United Kingdom from the lens of a middle-aged Chinese man.  This being said, I do have to admit that the writing overall was mediocre and that Lewis's strength is in the plot and not the actual narrative.  Truth be said, I read this book thinking that it would be an absolutely fabulous screenplay, and can totally see a movie made from it.  It seemed like a huge bulk of the novel centered upon what was essentially a long car chase.\n\nA decent read and a humble offering for thriller fans.

{"words": "First Sentence:  Jian walked into Leeds University and handed his message, written for him on the back of an aeroplane boarding pass, to the front desk security guard.\n\nInspector Jian is a man of personal and professional stature in his native China.  He receives a desperate call from his daughter, who is supposed to be studying in England, that sending him flying from his world into one completely foreign to him both in custom and language and into a world of smuggled migrants.\n\nThis book started so well.  The classic concept of a \"stranger in a strange land\" should have been fascinating.  It's a sad statement when the common element, which proved comforting for Jian, was signs for McDonalds, KFC and Nike.\n\nUnfortunately, my enthusiasm for the story waned quickly.  For me, the characters are, for the most part, unlikable.  The protagonist, Jian, is a tough, jaded cop.  Only at the very end do you see some slight humanity and redemption, but it's too little, too late.  The bad guys are very, very bad.  The migrant worker Ding Ming, was the exception but, because of his circumstances, he was such a weak character I lost interest.  Jian's daughter proved the most interesting but we don't come to know about her until near the end of the book.\n\nAlthough there was a lot of driving around, there was not a strong sense of place.  The book is very violent.  In itself, I can deal with that, but there was nothing to balance or offset it.  I also kept wonderful where the police were.  The lone man of vengeance may make for an exciting plot, but it just didn't quite play for me.\n\nThis book may appeal to those who like high-action noir, but I need a little more depth and dimension.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Human trafficking has gotten enough exposure in the last ten years that its worst excesses no longer have the power to shock and distress as they should. Which perhaps also helps to explain why it periodically pops up as the basis for fiction and film, as in this rapid-fire thriller. The twist this book provides is one of perspective -- instead of seeing human smuggling through the eyes of a sympathetic Western law enforcement hero seeking a young Westerner who has disappeared in some exotic locale, we see it through the eyes of a Chinese policeman trying to find his daughter in England. The classic fish-out-of-water device is given fresh life here, simply because we're not used to seeing the West as a foreign land filled with strange signs and cultural cues. But non-English-speaking Chinese cop Ma Jian is almost completely adrift in and around Leeds as he struggles to find a Mandarin speaker to help him.\n\nThe hunt for his missing daughter takes place over five action-packed days, pitting him against a cardboard crew of \"snakeheads\" (human traffickers) who bring Chinese into England illegally, and keep them trapped in a life of indentured servitude/slavery. A secondary storyline follows one of these smuggled-in workers as his naive faith in his new life slowly unravels as he in separated from his wife and set to manual labor. He happens to speak some English, which sets him apart from the other Fujian laborers he's placed with, and through a series of misadventures, ends up as the cop's hostage/sidekick. They make a very fun odd couple as they race around the countryside trying to locate the snakeheads. Lewis does a great job presenting their Chinese point-of-view, which has to feel authentic for the book to work. Unfortunately, he also employs an awkward framework that switches between three different narrative viewpoints and several different timelines, making for some confusing reading at times. Other flaws include the villains, who have virtually no depth to them at all, and a plot twist toward the end that pretty much every reader will see coming a mile away.\n\nStill, if you like thrillers, this is a pretty solid one that comes from an interesting perspective. The corrupt Chinese cop makes for an interesting anti-hero, as he is forced to confront his shallowness and culpability in his daughter's peril. And the sidekick is a wonderfully panicky teenager whose confusion over whom to trust is both tragic and comic. The pacing is great, with nonstop momentum and plenty of action interspersed. Probably destined to become a C-grade film starring someone like Jet Li.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "In the early 1980s, Martin Cruz Smith and Stuart M. Kaminsky--more or less simultaneously--wrote novels that followed decent detectives stuck investigating crime in the evil setting of the USSR. A few years later, Philip Kerr followed with the Bernhard Gunther books, which did the same thing for Nazi Berlin. Nowadays, the device is fairly common, The best recent example may be, Qiu Xiaolong's Chief Inspector Chen Cao books, set in the People's Republic of China. The appeal of the genre is that it amps up the tension of the original hard-boiled detectives, who only had to worry about the cops, the manipulative rich, and gangsters. For these newer heroes, it is the entire system of their native lands that is devoted to hiding truth and thwarting justice. They have to put themselves at tremendous risk to solve crimes and are required by their milieu to make compromises with their consciences. When done well, as by these authors, it is a form that makes for great reading.\n\nIf we forget about the Arnold Schwarzenegger film, Red Heat--and it does deserve forgetting--Simon Lewis may be one of the first to reverse this idea and have a detective/policeman from a totalitarian nation come to the West to investigate a crime. In this case, Inspector Jian travels from Beijing to Britain in search of his daughter, who's disappeared from University after a frantic phone call. Mr. Lewis makes the most of the fish-out-of-water potential and even works in a more naive sort of sidekick, Ding Ming, an illegal immigrant worker whose wife is missing. The view of England through their eyes is revealing and often funny and the action sequences are handled smoothly.\n\nBut I had a problem with the whole exercise. Why exactly am I supposed to root for a PRC henchman? Here's how Jian is described:\n\n  He had loved and hated as directed and worshipped Mao without reservation. There'd been songs and passion and a sense of purpose. Then times changed, and the lights he'd been brought up to live by had been shown to lead nowhere. Past struggles had been revealed as a tremendous waste of time. his idol Mao was an old f[***] and a fraud. Well, he would not be fooled again. He believed in nothing now -- there was only luck and money, and you'd better have one or the other.\n\nCall me old-fashioned, but I want more than that from my heroes. And his daughter is nearly as unsympathetic. The help he ends up providing to Ding Ming and the fact that the crooks he's up against are so reprehensible does enable us to root for him by the end, but rather reluctantly. Generally when we come upon his sort in a noir it is his demise we enjoy, not his triumph. This seems likely to be a series and we'll have to hope than Inspector Jian finds some things worth believing in so that we can want him to succeed.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Human trafficking and snuff have become pretty popular topics in the last nine years of fiction, it seems to me. And so has China, practically a medieval nation outside its major cities until the turn of the century.\n\nGood genre writing--well, commercial writing at least--reflect current issues and cultural interests. Sure, but genre fiction really crackles when the author loves his or her subjects. Such is the case with Simon Lewis and his second \"travel/suspense\" novel, *Bad Traffic*.\n\nYou know what travel/suspense is--James Bond does it all the time. Historically, white slave traders would ship British girls across Asia, often with little regard for their safe arrival (they could always send more). But while I'm used to reading Brits or Americans threatened by sinister foreigners in distant lands, Lewis turns the thriller on its head. For the distant land is the West, and the foreigners speak English.\n\nInspector Jian, a widowed veteran and well-connected Chinese Police Inspector, sent his only child to Leeds University. Ostensibly for education, but practically to straighten out her troublesome streaks. Only trouble of the worst kind cries out of his cell phone one day, and 32 hours later, the good Inspector finds himself in England without a friend, a weapon, or a single word of the local language.\n\nDing Ming, an educated but poorly-connected husband, speaks English well enough to get himself into trouble. Which is one reason why he and his wife indebted themselves $40,000 plus interest to be smuggled into the Gold Mountain of Great Britain. His bosses seem perverted but fair, offering a generous 1 dollar an hour minus expenses. If only they hadn't separated him from his wife...\n\nYou know Jian and Ming will cross, in ways terrifying, exciting, and absurd. Especially when they cross Black Fort, a petty gangbanger with tong ambitions and an eye for daughters and wives.\n\n*Bad Traffic* is suspense all the way, replete with situational humor and subtle twists on the genre. What Jian lacks in local customs and comprehension, he more than makes up with police brutality, Red Guard training, and the cunning of a Chinese social strategist. Simon paints him as an over-the-hill Asian Bruce Willis, with less emphasis on the guns and more on the bullheaded rampage through the English shop, er, countryside. Jian's struggles remind him of his own country's dark and often murderous past, as the search for his daughter leads to desperate actions.\n\nMing knows darkness too, especially as a peasant who watched arrogant officials like Jian get life handed to them on a silver plate.  Yet his flight to England is one of wonder, surprise, and often painful naivet. Ming isn't exactly a comical sidekick, so much as a pitiable little guy who keeps up his optimism and devotion to duty, no matter how obscene the situation becomes.\n\nSimon weaves these protagonists into his plots like any good, if formulaic suspense writer. The story twists and turns like a sports car on hilly English roads, and practically every chapter changes the reality of whatever came before. Here and there, strategically placed sections backtrack to different POVs or plot threads, or otherwise delve into some seemingly mundane sideshow--often after a cliffhanger.\n\n*Bad Traffic* is violent and profane, but not graphically so. Lewis gets the point across--often in a deft lunge at the unsuspecting reader--with just the right amount of f-bombs and twitching limbs. He has an old fashioned appreciation for the dashing hero and the damsel in distress, while his story remains cognizant of the treatment of gender in Western societies. Objectification is limited to the bad people point of view, and female distress is largely de-sexualized. Most of the male characters, for their part, are neither muscle-toned Bruce Lees nor romantic rogues, but often pudgy and middle-aged working men.\n\nGetting into style, his prose is perfunctory and consistent. Lewis doesn't bog things down with chunks of back-story or description. Instead, character and setting flow along with the story. He is careful to limit narrative commentary or character thoughts. Nevertheless, the story teaches along the way, integrating Chinese and British culture directly into the action and dialogue.\n\nGiven this, the book is an easy read. Perhaps a bit lower on the scale than this very review, anybody with a ninth grade comprehension level should get it. I took three days to finish, only because of other work. This is an ideal read for a plane, train, or bus ride.\n\nStill, the writing sputters a bit. However tight, Simon still uses too many words to build his sentences. I'm also not a fan of the \"he was, she was\" speech style that Western writers took from Hemingway like a divine commandment. Finally, I didn't recognize some of the British slang, but understood it well enough in context.\n\nThat's all quibble anyways. I mainly found disappointment with how the story sometimes degenerates into cardboard gun fights or chases. One major character is a student of Wing Chun martial arts, but doesn't it put to use, especially not in the climax. Also, the writing is occasionally a little obtuse on details. I can't tell whether characters are shooting revolvers or semi-auto pistols, and the plot doesn't exploit details like this anyways. I know it's a stupid little thing, but it kind of threw me off when the bad guys periodically appear with shotguns, only to announce at the end that these were double-barreled hunting weapons, not pump-action police specials.\n\nOtherwise, this is my first Lewis Simon book. Through Amazon Vine, the first I've heard of him. As *Bad Traffic* is headlined as \"An Inspector Jian Novel\", I wouldn't mind seeing a series with his level of talent and cultural appreciation.\n\nAs such, it deserves to be the first Amazon Vine book I've awarded four stars. The story is formulaic and familiar enough, but that's not a bad thing. For mystery and suspense buffs, *Bad Traffic* offers a solid road to travel.", "label": "good review"}

I can say that it is just as good the second time around.  Even knowing what happened and who the clones were, I was captivated, still reading with new/old eyes in to the nuances of the characters and subtle shifts that were telltale signs I didn't see the first time around.  The plot is your basic survival/end of the world story line.  We have a community of people, there are power struggles and physical struggles, but the survivors seem to have a hierarchy system in place that actually works.  This is where we meeting our hero Daniel, while not the `leader', or even the one who herded the survivors into the fallout shelter to begin with, he's a leader all his own. He and his best friend Lucas are the main ones who go out looking for caches of supplies and food.  This is where the story twists.\n\nWhile the plot line is about the politics and struggle of daily life for survivors, it's also about their main enemies, the Shifters.  These are genetically mutated beings who, as far as Daniel can tell, mutating even more... not good for the survivors. I'm not going to give away any more of the story.  And there is so much more. Not all shifters are evil, people aren't who they seem, and the good Doctor has a hunch of why the world has collapsed.  You need to read it for yourselves; it's a great end of the world sci-fi novel that leaves a lot more of the plot line open for future books.  In fact there are two more; in addition I was just informed that the writer is currently finishing up the screen play. While some readers claim it starts off slow... well it does a little...

The prose flows well. The dialogue is realistic, sharp, and witty. The characters are well developed and interesting.\n\nThis story developed at a quick pace. There were plenty of twists and turns and even a couple hairpin turns that caused my breath to catch in my throat. The mystery kept me guessing. The romance was interesting and believable to me. The conclusion left me feeling satisfied yet interested in learning more about Val Virgo. I particularly enjoyed the flavor added by the Winnipeg setting. I could see the great, white north, and I've never even been there.\n\nThis is a good book. Yes, the narrative voice is sarcastic. As one with a deep sarcastic streak myself, I liked it.

Christmas Eve Can Kill You is a clever, laugh-out-loud, edge-of-the-seat murder mystery, a first novel from a gifted Canadian author who writes with wicked humor, knife-edge intelligence, and a strong point of view that brings alive the culture and calamities of life above the border in the depressing Winnipeg winter.\n\nMarantz is head and shoulders above the rest in this crowded genre. His eccentric humor and crystal clear prose are what you might get if you crossed Jasper Fford with Michael Chabon. His energetic writing pulls you by the collar through a tangled plot that he deftly untwists. Val Virgo, failed country singer and indifferent talk-show host, is as unforgettable as that screwball friend who used to crack you up in school. Marantz creates heroes who are flawed and bad guys have good parts, and you end up believing them all.\n\nGranted, there are moments when you can lose the thread, but not many and never for long. And for readers south of the Provinces, some of the local color and Canadian references can take a few extra milliseconds to puzzle out. Still, my mouse hovered between a four and a five star rating only because of the weak copy-editing that left a dirty ring of typos around the tub.

Interesting idea.  There were a few places that the author tried to bring in scientific facts, an  each time he did so, he missed the boat.  E.g.. While it's true that early in the 20th century there were studies that appeared to show a weight loss at the time of death of 21 grams, far more recent studies have shown no such loss.  One of the characters in the book, wonders why no one since that 1st  study has repeated it, as I already noted that they have.  Each time he does this I wonder why he didn't check his facts.  Books that weave strongly researched facts in with an original idea strengthen their characters and plot.  It diminishes the book.  The greatest books are those which weave in facts and fiction in such a way th a t they are nearly inseparable.  I am both a Christian and a scientist and though I really enjoyed the book, but more research and inclusion of it would have made for a better read.  I do think that this book presents clinched topics in a novel way, and that is a laudable achievement.

{"words": "I almost didn't finish Nightfall.  The first part of the book, the part shown off in the free Kindle sample enticed me.  It wasn't much further in, however, that the book started to drag for a bit.  There's a lot of establishment early on which slows things down, but I don't think I would have enjoyed the end if Leather hadn't established the world and people around Jack Nightingale so thoroughly.  By the last third of the book, I didn't want to put it down.\n\nJack Nightingale himself is a bit of a clich; he's an ex-cop whose career ended under controversy and ended up as a struggling PI.  What makes him shine is that the character is charming.  He's witty, intelligent, and competent.  He sets his logical mind towards solving the mystery around the appearance and suicide of a man claiming to be his father, the sudden windfall (and debt surrounding it), and supposed curse.  He is a rational man who doesn't believe that his father could have sold his soul.  However, as people start dying around him, he is shaken.  I found this easy to relate to; no matter how logical we may be, circumstances like Jack's would likely shake our foundations.\n\nWhen people around Jack start to die, he begins to question everything even as the police begin to suspect the body count that surrounds him.  He very much begins to believe that devils might be real, and one might come collecting for his soul.\n\nBy the end of the book, I was very invested in the character, and I must say that it was worth the slog towards the beginning.\n\nBottom Line:  read the free sample.

With the help of his feisty assistant, Jack frantically works to find out why the people around him tell him he's going to hell and then kill themselves.\n\nThis is an entertaining beginning of a series. There isn't really anything new here. We've all read occult stories or seen occult movies. We've all seen the grizzled, alcoholic, washed-up former cop now making a buck as a private investigator.

{"words": "I actually finished this book over 12 hours ago, but then I crashed and went to sleep. So here's the review.  this is the plain-text only version; to see the formatting and links, please visit my blog, Now is Gone (a link to which can be found in my profile).\n\nBook Info: Genre: Urban Fantasy/Occult Detective\nReading Level: Adult\nRecommended for: Fans of fast-paced and darkly humorous urban fantasy\nTrigger Warnings: murder, suicide, pedophilia\n\nMy Thoughts: After reading Once Bitten a couple years ago (review linked here where formatting allowed), I went through Stephen Leather's available books and added a number to my wishlist. When Midnight, the 2nd book in this series, came available through Vine, I saw it was on my list and grabbed it and then bought this book (first in the series). My point is I enjoy this author's writing style and expected something that was dark but with a touch of humor, and that was exactly what I received. The story is fast-paced and furious, often quite dark and nasty, but with unexpected bits of humor to lighten things just when it is most needed.\n\nThe only major problem I had was that there was some sloppiness in the editing department. Not spelling and grammar, but problems with inconsistencies in the plot. For instance, Jack explicitly says several times that the master bedroom in Gosling manor has been cleaned perfectly, leaving no traces of blood spatter or chalk, yet when he finds the CCTV viewing area and looks at it through the CCTV cameras, he describes seeing the outline of the body and the chalk on the floor. At another point, when he first meets Rebecca, she opens her mouth and he describes her mouth as having no tongue, only ulcerated gums, yet two paragraphs later her tongue is described as being coated and later she actually speaks. These sorts of things should have been caught and fixed well before publication.\n\nBut not everyone is likely to have noticed that, I suppose; it's just one of those things I noticed. There was also a comment that really started me thinking. Someone said, \"Apparently quite a few people who dabble in the occult top themselves.\" Weirdly enough, this sort of attitude seems to be fairly wide-spread, because I had a doctor tell me as much at one point. A lot of people seem to think that people who are involved in the occult or supernatural or consider themselves Pagan because despondent as a result (for some reason). I don't think that's the way things work at all. I think people who tend to be despondent about how the world is tend to turn toward the occult and supernatural and Paganism as a place to belong, as a place where they won't be constantly judged and have fingers pointed at them and told they are going to hell. I think these people are just a lot more likely to take their own destiny into their own hands and decide to move on to what comes next sooner out of a hope that it is better than the mess this world is in. That's what I think.\n\nAnyway, this is a book that is more focused on a male readership, I think. The pace is fast and the characters are developed, but the plot is mostly focused on action and not talking, and that's just fine with me. I really enjoy these sorts of stories, and I'll probably end up buying the final book in this series for myself to read before too much more time passes. In the meantime, I'll be moving on to the 2nd book in the series, Midnight, next.\n\nDisclosure: I bought this book for myself. All opinions are my own.\n\nSynopsis: `You are going to Hell, Jack Nightingale.' They are the words that ended Jack Nightingale's career as a negotiator with the Metropolitan Police. But two years later, when Nightingale is a struggling Private Eye, the words come back to haunt him.

{"words": "Apart from the fact that it's slow and rather poorly written, this so-called \"supernatural thriller\" fails at its central premise. I'm surprised that no reviewer here has yet pointed out the elephant in the room (well, one reviewer sort of mentioned it), but our elephant is right there and it's impossible to avoid it: You cannot sell somebody else's soul to any devil, from Satan down. Period. If there is anything most Christian religions agree on, is that. This novel's main idea is that a man has sold his not-yet-conceived son's soul to a devil and now the son, a grown man when we meet him, must try to lawyer his way out of a contract he never signed. Leather uses a lot of Christian paraphernalia and ideas to deliver a message that contradicts everything Christian doctrine teaches. Just think about it. If such a deal were possible it would be the religious equivalent of borrowing from the Mob and telling the wise guys that your neighbor, or your nephew, or Bill Gates will pay the debt, \"your\" debt. The Mob could take deals like that but it doesn't because it understands that such a business wouldn't work at all: there is a logic to extortion and the mafia is a business after all. And there is a logic to the idea of hell, Satan, his demons, and Heaven, God and His angels. You can't have Satan and his minions happily getting fat on souls that had nothing to do with the deal, even if those souls are corruptible, even if we apply the dubious medieval concept of Purgatory and babies who die unbaptized. What Leather, the author, does, is to take what seems like a good prop from religion (the concept of Good and Evil as metaphysical entities) and twist it to suit his novel's plot. But the whole concoction comes up burned on top and uncooked in the middle. Maybe he will explain this unholy mess in the next two books, and one way is to say that blood rules, that a father, genetically linked to a descendant, can, indeed, sell his descendant's soul to a devil. But that wouldn't save this novel or the trilogy from choosing and picking badly. One tenet that Leather ignores to the detriment of his book, and he does so because it demolishes the plot, is that people choose to sell to the devil or his minions the only thing worth pursuing, from a religious standpoint: their souls. They can't barter their children's souls away any more that they can barter what isn't theirs, because their children's souls are not theirs to barter. If we go the Calvinist route, Leather can't even write his book, since Predestination trumps everything and those who'll be saved will be saved no matter what a devil or Satan himself may want or do. And here we come to a very important point that Leather forgets in his very disrespectful romp through two thousand years of belief: this is about souls, not lives, so the stakes are infinitely higher. I am an atheist, but I understand Christianity, and one essential aspect of it is that God may seem uncaring at times, indifferent, or downright cruel to us humans, but He is never impotent, and He is never weaker than Satan and his minions. Remember, God \"made\" Satan and all the angels that chose to follow him in the Fall. Does it even seem remotely possible that the creator of Heaven, Earth, and the Universe, the one whose name Leather's characters invoke several times in the book, especially at the end when trying to communicate with a soul, would allow unborn children's souls to be carried away by the truckload by the likes of Azazel, Asmodeus, or, in the novel's case, Proserpine? Afraid not. It just doesn't work that way. When writing fantasy, if the writer forgets or ignores his own universe's rules, he weakens the story and may even fatally damage the entire book. Leather has chosen to write a fantasy novel using, badly, some concepts from established Christian religions, ignoring most of them, and serving us a bad attempt at the supernatural. But supernatural does not mean careless and free-for-all. The elephant is right there in the room and the whole house has collapsed around it.\n\nIf you enjoy supernatural thrillers that are well-written and deal precisely with Fallen Angels, demons, possessions, etc., look no further than John Connoly's books. Some are better than others, but all are much, much better than this sorry jumble of sentences, cliches, ideas and concepts that the author either hasn't studied or chose to ignore.", "label": "bad review"}

In Nightfall you follow Jack Nightingale, a smart private investigator that somehow managed to have his soul sold to the devil. Without giving away much, I have to say that Nightfall is a unique story with plenty of action and some nice twists. Its only real downfall is the fact that the story is a little slow at the start.

Why he's a FORMER cop is explained in painful detail in the introductory chapters, but I don't want to spoil the the story with too many details. His life now is much different and Nightingale is a changed man. Most of his casework is unfaithful spouses, but it pays the bills most of the time. His current hum drum life of drudgery all changes when he's told that he has inherited a large mansion from a deceased father he never knew existed. This isn't the life Nightingale asked for or ever wished for.\n\n\"Your going to hell Nightingale\" or is he. what follows is an unorthodox tale about devil worship and demons from the perspective of an astute cop and non-believer. The story challenges our understanding of right and wrong, while also exploring themes about the meaning of life and the inevitability of death. It also ponders whether who we are is influenced by the environment we grew up in, or is dictated by birth,\n\nNightingale learns that there is a lot about his past, and his life that was different from what he knew growing up. This well written story was riveting, and had equal parts paranormal and police procedural. Nightingale is a flawed human being with his heart in the right place. he is helped by a secretary, who though young and attractive, is ultimately overqualified for the position she works. Why does she work for me, Nightingale wonders on more than one occasion. Their relationship in this book is one of the more interesting elements of the story. Whether it will evolve into a romance is uncertain, though it is clear they both have feelings for each other. He is also helped by a cop buddy friend from his former life.\n\nI don't want to give too much of the story away, just know that I found Nightingales journey of discovery to be fascinating and the philosophical elements interesting and provocative. It's not just a story about self-discovery, but a journey into the unknown and uncertain. It's also a story that is at times heart-wrenching.

I suppose the author will wrap everything up in the third book, but I hate when authors do that.  There are a number of questions that come to mind when you read this (why in the world is this going on?  why is this happening? etc), not least of which is the question of self-determination vs pre-ordained fate, where does personal choice come in, and why would someone be held to a \"contract\" that they (personally) were never involved in negotiating?

{"words": "I decided to borrow this book from the Kindle lending library once I chose book two in the series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Midnight-Nightingale-Book-Two/dp/1612182305/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Midnight (Nightingale: Book Two)</a>, from the Amazon Vine Voices program.  That book description made it sound like it would be very interesting, but it also sounded like I might want to start the series from the beginning in order to have all the characters and basic story concept firmly in place.  I'm glad I made the decision because this novel was a good thriller with the delving into the paranormal aspect which made it slightly different.  Jack Nightingale was a member of the Metropolitan Police Force of London as a negotiator with hostage takers or potential suicides.  One of his cases caused him to resign from the force and for the past two years he has been a private investigator.  Jack is informed that his entire life has been based on false information when he is bequeathed Gosling Manor.  Now in just a matter of days Jack will reach a birth date milestone and a devil will arrive to take his soul.\n\nThe premise of the novel was quite intriguing and well plotted so that aspect was accomplished very nicely.  The characters are mostly good, although some are made to be a little too shallow for my tastes.  I'm sorry the author decided to sacrifice one particularly good character because that person really could have been of value in the remaining books of the series.  I thought Jack Nightingale's reaction to the deaths of all the many people who died in this novel was quite strange.  It was almost as if he had very little emotional connection with the deaths at all, no matter what his relationship to the recently deceased.  Although, I must say they all did give him another excuse to drink far too much and often and smoke far too much and often.  In fact, I got thoroughly tired of all the drinking and smoking.  As well as all the references to the 'MGB'.  Why not just call it a car?  Definitely call it a car more than twice in the entire book (as far as I can remember).  It was not a natural feeling way for someone to refer to the vehicle they drive.  I know absolutely no person who speaks of their vehicle by the make or even the model name on a constant, regular basis.\n\nMy main quarrel with this novel was two-fold:  the repetition of dumb questions which got dumb answers and the repetition of the discussions about heaven and hell.  Favorite questions occurred time and time again:  You aren't really going to do this are you?  You don't really believe all this do you?  You aren't really going to go there are you?  You didn't really do that did you?  All of which were answered by Jack with, yes I do, yes I did, yes I can, yes I will, yes I have.  Then there are at least seven episodes of Jack discussing with different people whether or not heaven and hell actually exist and where specifically they are -- as in a geographical location.  All of which ended up with exactly the same conclusion.  I understand that Jack was dealing with a devil who would take his soul which would leave him dead.  But to have the same discussion with so many people and come up with exactly the same conclusion each time was almost a deal breaker for me.  If the book had not been on my Kidle I might have been tempted to toss it across the room.  And to make matters even worse, there was repetition within the repetitiously themed conversations.  Holy guacamole!  I got to the point of hoping I wasn't in for yet another round of heaven/hell discussions only to be shown that my hope would be dashed on some tombstone.\n\nI am glad I read this first book in the series before starting the second because there is so much backstory and character development for Jack in this book that it will help me immensely with the second and possible the third book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Nightmare-Nightingale-Book-Three/dp/1612182313/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Nightmare (Nightingale: Book Three )</a>, due for release in the U.S. in November 2012.  This is the first book I've read by Stephen Leather.  When I was checking out the Jack Nightingale series I noticed that Leather has another series featuring Dan Shepherd which has been running for a long time and seems to have high reviewer ranking.  Maybe I'll go check that series out to see if this Nightingale series is a departure from the author's usual writing style.  At least maybe I won't have to read about the 'MGB'.", "label": "bad review"}

PI Jack Nightingale isn't doing very well since leaving the police force after dealing with a horrible case where he's alleged to have thrown a suspect out of a window.  He'd be justified.  Drinking, smoking and in debt, he agrees to meet a lawyer at the lawyer's office believing it's for a case.  Jack quickly learns that he'd been adopted, his biological father died and left him a large estate with a mansion, and on his 33rd birthday in 3 weeks, a devil is coming to claim his soul.  People close to him start dying as he tries to learn the truth and find a way to prevent it.\n\nThe intensity is there, but the pace is really slow and I actually set it aside a couple of times.

{"words": "Jack Nightingale was well on his way to establishing his career as a top police negotiator when suddenly everything began to go horribly wrong.  While on a particularly troubling case his negotiations failed terribly, resulting in the death a a child.  Jack was then suspected of causing the death of a 'person of interest', a person who had made a very interesting statement to Jack before falling to his death, which had resulted in Jack leaving the police under a cloud of suspicion.  Now, just as Jack was beginning to re-establish his life events began to unfold that lead Jack to question everything he had known to be true about his life and himself.\n\nThis is the first in what is planned to be a trilogy of stories about Jack as he investigates crimes with paranormal overtones.  The paranormal aspects, at least in this first novel, are rather subtle.  The reality as we know it is altered only slightly, and for the most part, in ways that are only noticeable by Jack.  The result is that instead of giving the reader to reassurance that this has to be fiction that the more over the top DRESDAN FILES or SOUTHERN VAMPIRE series supply Jack's circumstances are a bit creepier.  The evidence of paranormal activity is available only to Jack and those who might aid him in dealing with it are eliminated from his life.  There are intriguing loose ends in this novel, ones that hold great promise for the remaining two novels in the series.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I've read other books by Stephen Leather and must say that I think he's a competent writer. I was looking forward to this one, since it marks the start of a series with potential: demons, a private investigator, missing persons and lost souls. But any book with horror as a major factor needs to show emotion, and lots of it. The hero, Jack Nightingale, seems strangely unaffected by events. His parents died tragically when he was 19, but it seems that he managed just fine: finished school, joined the police force, and so on. Now he's in his thirties and a private investigator, using his overdrawn credit card to pay his bills, and he's learned that in a few weeks a demon is coming to claim his soul. It's fine for him to greet this news skeptically, but as events pile up, each one worse than the last, he has to cross over into a realm where common sense doesn't apply. He's assisted by his secretary, but again, there's a lack of emotion - we're told that she favors him, but we don't feel any chemistry between them. Although there are physical descriptions indicative of strong feelings - like Jack awakening in a sweat from nightmares, or being startled in a churchyard and falling down from the surprise - I simply don't feel, or see, any deep emotions or internal turbulence. This makes it difficult for me to align my sympathies with Jack, which is a prerequisite for following the series in future. I might try the next book to see if it gets better, but I'm not sure I'm invested in the character. It's a reasonable read, though, and I'd recommend it for something like a beach or vacation selection.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "When looking for some new author's to read, I ran across some consistently high Amazon reviews for author Stephen Leather ( http://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Leather/e/B000APS0ZM/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1 ).  Not wanting to jump into one of his longer running series, I picked up Nightfall which is the first of a trilogy of books based around Jack Nightingale (yeah, I know, not very subtle).  So with the character name setting a bad start, I grudgingly proceeded to read the book fearing I had stuck myself with some genre sludge written to tap the exploding reader interest in this area.  And in the blink of an eye, fifty pages had passed and I was hooked.  Huh, I didn't see that coming.\n\nTurns out there is a reason the author has received all those 4-5 star reviews, he really knows how to write a solid book, and does a particularly good job of balancing tension and plot advancement, while crafting interesting characters and realistic dialog.  All too often, books of this genre have dialog that is jarringly bad in spots (aka nobody talks like that in real life) or plot devices of the worst sort of Dues Ex Machina kind.  Leather does not fall into either trap.  Its clear the Nightfall series benefits from the author's experiences writing his previous books, as in the wrong hands this could have been a terrible book.  Instead, it ended up a well written, terrifically executed take on the genre.\n\nFor fans of the author- if you had not ordered already, feel free to go ahead.  You won't be disappointed.  For others new to Stephen Leather, I think this would be a great jump in point on a talented author.  While I wait for the next two books in the series, I will probably start working my way through his earlier works as well.

{"words": "From Amazon Vine's description, I had no idea that this was the first of a trilogy featuring ex-cop and now PI, Jack Nightingale.  Or that it had actually been published in the UK a couple of years ago, or that the second and final novels were also out in the UK (but not available through Amazon in the US).  But no matter, Nightfall was exactly as advertised  - the story of how Jack discovers that his father had sold his unborn son's soul to a devil who would come and collect on his 33rd birthday.  Naturally,  Jack is not happy about this and does his best to stop this from happening as (almost) all his friends and family are dropping like flies all around him in the days leading up to his 33rd.\n\nThe writing was fine, and the pacing good.  There were fewer plot twists than expected and in truth this was more like a police or detective procedural than a heavy-duty occult fantasy.  Still, I enjoyed it.  One could read it and not feel trapped into following up with the rest of the series (when they become available in the US), as there is pretty good closure at the end.  On the other hand, there were clearly plot threads left untied at the end and I was not surprised to find that there were more books in the series.\n\nJack was just a bit too clichd to draw me completely in. Chain smoker (Marlboros of course), heavy drinker and with a slightly ambiguous past as a cop.  His girl Friday (or Jenny in this case) was something of an enigma.  Smart, young wealthy, but no other personality.  No sexual tension between Jack and her, in fact except for some of the descriptions of the suicides/murders, the entire novel was pretty much PG rated.  No sex, no gore, no real horror.

{"words": "Summary: In British suspense writer Stephen Leather's new novel \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Nightfall-Nightingale-Book-One/dp/1612182291/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Nightfall (Nightingale: Book One)</a>,\" Jack Nightingale is a private dick with a dark past, a stack of unpaid bills, a sexy secretary, a bottle of booze in his desk, and a lit cigarette hanging from his lips. Out of nowhere, Jack receives a message from his recently-deceased biological father: \"Sorry, kid, but I sold your soul to a devil. She'll be dropping by on your 33rd birthday to pick it up.\" That's just a couple of weeks away, so when people around him begin dying and random people start telling him \"You're going to hell, Jack Nightingale,\" Jack knows he has to take this crazy message seriously. But what can he do?\n\nThe Bad: Packed with cliche, and slow, slow, S-L-O-W. By the middle of the novel, I was wondering whether Leather was going to save Jack's 33rd birthday for the third volume in this planned trilogy. (Answer: No, fortunately.)\n\nThe Good: I'm not familiar with Leather's other work, but he's obviously a skilled and occasionally-thoughtful writer. Despite the torpid pace of \"Nightfall,\" he's able to maintain enough tension and mystery to keep his not-quite-bored-to-tears readers turning the pages. Jack's conversations with with clergy and others about death, heaven, and hell resonate, at least a little, and some of the atmospheric bits are well done. (That does NOT include the repeated scratching sounds Jack hears at his dad's house or the even more frequently repeated lamentations about how you can't smoke in bars anymore.) Most of the humor is hackneyed film noir banter, but it's still entertaining. And, finally, the book's conclusion is not half-bad: it resolves enough to satisfy readers but leaves enough up in the air to justify a second volume.\n\nAdditional comment: We know from the get-go that Jack's dad sold his soul to a devil (not THE devil, FWIW), and that the devil is going to be coming to collect it. Leather makes (almost) no effort to suggest that this is NOT what's going to happen. That being the case, to put off the inevitable until late in the book is (figurative) torture. Maybe Leather WANTED to frustrate readers. I don't know, but that's definitely what he does in \"Nightfall\".\n\nBottom line: This is an OK book. I read so little horror that I can't say how it compares to similar novels in the same genre. I can say, however, that it is both less exciting and less imaginative than kindred books in dark urban fantasy, like Jim Butcher's Dresden Files or Kat Richardson's Greywalker series.

{"words": "Once I started this book, I couldn't quit. I was sure that Jack would find a way out of his predicament and I had to find out how he managed it. I loved every single page. Although the emphasis of the book description is on the supernatural elements of the book, Nightfall does not really fall neatly into a single genre. Yes, the supernatural figures prominently, but the book is, at heart, a mystery, with Jack, in true private investigator fashion, doggedly following one lead to another to another in his efforts to unravel the puzzle dropped in his lap by a man who claimed to be his father. Add in a few discussions of philosophy and religion (What happens after you die? What is the meaning of life?) and more humor than I expected and you get a pleasing, well rounded story.\n\nJack Nightingale is an appealing character -  likable, funny, smart, and yet in many ways very ordinary. The other characters in the book ranged from bizarre to ordinary, but all were entirely believable and felt very real.\n\nI highly recommend this book to almost anyone. If the book sounds interesting to you, go ahead and pick up a copy because you are likely to enjoy it. I can't wait to start the second book in this series.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Some people just can't catch a break.\n\nFirst, Jack Nightingale may or may not have killed a man, so his police career is over and replaced by a pretty shabby career as a private detective. Then, random people start telling him that, \"You are going to hell, Jack...\" Then at age 32 he finds out he was adopted, which was bad enough until he finds out who his birthfather was. And as if that is not enough, he finds out that his birth father sold his soul to a devil, who is coming in a couple of weeks to collect.\n\nWow, that could really keep you from looking forward to your birthday.\n\nIn the novel, Jack has to face the unexpected and then the unlikely. In fact, a fair amount seems to be simple insanity. As he finds out more, though, he also realizes that he had better be ready for anything--much of that insanity is starting to sound all too likely.\n\nStephen Leather introduces us in this book to a protagonist who is a good man to know, but who has to face a personal crisis beyond anything he has already faced. How he meets this crisis makes it clear that he is would be a good person to have on your side. The question is whether just being a good person is enough to get out of \"You are going to hell, Jack...\"", "label": "good review"}

In his birthday he is told that it has kind of been sold to the devil. This leads to Jack try to overcome the pact and into some really interesting story features.\nMakes you kind of wonder if he'll just skip the next few birthdays, too.\n\nI don't want to short the story with the breakdown that gives away anything major but I also do not want this to sound too basic so I want to note that leaving the synopsis at that because of spoilers, noting that if the description sounds good, read it. It  takes a lot more turns and is very effective in not only in making me want to continue reading but also in fleshing out the characters and making them interesting.

Obviously this isn't the sort of message one wants to get from one's father, but to make it worse, people he needs help from start dying in mysterious and terrible ways, and he repeatedly gets the message that he's on the way to hell.\n\nTorn by disbelief and after lots of theological soul-searching, he begins to seek the knowledge hidden in the library, but will he be able to resolve his problem before his number comes up?\n\nA fast paced and exciting read, this imperfect detective is a wonderfully compelling protagonist in what promises to be a spookily cool series.\n\nAmanda Richards, January 7, 2012", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "In NIGHTFALL, author Stephen Leather takes (presumably temporary) leave of his otherwise ongoing hero, Dan \"Spider\" Shepherd, to give his followers a novel of the occult. Perhaps Leather is contemplating a new direction for the Shepherd series and is stalling for time vis-&agrave;-vis his publisher? Be that as it may, NIGHTFALL is an unexpected treat for those fans seeking a hiatus from the Spider adventures that are perhaps verging uncomfortably close on the too-predictable.\n\nHere, Jack Nightingale is a struggling London private-eye and a former member of the Metropolitan Police's elite CO19 armed response unit, from which he was forced out under a cloud after a suicide-prevention incident went horribly wrong. During his daily routine of catching-out cheating spouses, Jack now learns that he's been willed a palatial country home by a previously unknown man, Ainsley Gosling, claiming to be Nightingale's biological father. Why, the inheritance tax alone will ruin Jack's finances. And then there's the DVD, made shortly before Gosling blew his brains out with a shotgun, on which he apologizes for selling his son's soul to a devil at birth, the delivery due on Nightingale's thirty-third birthday two weeks hence.\n\nAs Jack resists belief and the last few days before the closing date trickle away, the bodies begin to pile up as relatives, a close friend, and assorted others meet horrible -- sometimes gruesome - ends. And the teenage girl dressed in Goth black and too much mascara and accompanied by an attentive Border collie. What's she all about?\n\nAs a teenager, I enjoyed many novels of the occult. Books by Dennis Wheatley come to mind as representative favorites of my youth, though such pretty much never transit my bookshelf now. However, I recall that the sale of one's soul to the devil is a standard concept of the genre, so nothing in the first three-quarters of NIGHTFALL promised to elevate this thriller above three, perhaps four, stars. That is, until the last couple of chapters, when Nightingale's special talents as a hostage negotiator delivered the book into five-star range with a riveting conclusion.\n\nAt one point, Jack ponders whether or not a soul exists. Since the reader of any author of fiction may wonder how much the scribbler imbues the story's main character with his/her own traits, I'm left to speculate if Leather is pondering the existence and state of his own writer's soul as he ages. Does he perhaps think that selling it to his publisher in exchange for undreamed of wealth and power in the literary world too great a price? After all, the devil is in the contractual details.\n\nIn any case, Stephen, thank you for another terrific yarn which added considerable entertainment to four days of my life.

I have to say that I've never read a book quite like this.  If you've seen The Never Ending Story or Alice in Wonderland, this book is similar to those tales.  It was kind of weird, the day after I saw Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, I came to the part of this book where Alice appears.\n\nI really enjoyed the book.  It's very well written and has a great message without being too preachy.  The characters are very interesting.  There are times when the stories within the stories can get a little confusing as we have a father reading a bedtime story to his children about their grandfather's adventures which include him as a child.  The book also felt a little long to me for a kind of light hearted story.  And, while a shorter version might be appropriate for children, there were a couple of passages that got pretty intense and I'm not sure I'd want my younger daughter (10) to read.\n\nAll in all, it was a fun read and I would definitely recommend the book.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Although I really think that tweens and teens will thoroughly enjoy \"Sleepwalker: The Last Sandman\" I think the book has a great story and meaning to offer to adults as well.  The storytelling is tight and fast paced, but it was the sort of book that you almost didn't want to finish, because you knew you'd miss the characters when the last page was done.  The characters are realistic and even in the most fantastic of situations the author finds them in, you can hear the truth of the characters as you read.\n\nThe fantasy elements are so neatly done, that you find yourself believing them just as much as you believe in the more mundane and recognizable reality that Jake, Cole & Sean are experiencing in the story.  Many authors can make fantasy exciting and others can make reality realistic, but to be able to do both is something you don't often seen in YA novels.  Also, unlike many YA books, this story had characters that both boys and girls would be interested in.  This is definitely not a book that will be pegged as a book just for boys or just for girls.\n\nI could easily have seen our family reading this book as a read-aloud book when my daughter was younger.  The chapters are of a manageable size for an evening's read.\n\nBut more than that, this book touched on many subjects and emotions that I, as a mother of a teenager who is rapidly preparing to go out on her own, was deeply touched by.  The love of children for their parents, the love of parents for their children, the strength of children, the weaknesses in even the best parent figures - all of these themes come into play in \"Sleepwalker:The Last Sandman\" in a way that made it more than worth my time to read.\n\nI usually archive books as soon as I finish them, but this one I have left on my Kindle.

{"words": "Plot/Storyline: 4 Stars\n\nThis was an extremely imaginative tale that takes place mostly in the dream world of Nod. There is even a surprising explanation for why it is called `Nod.' Although this is listed as a YA novel, it is just as enjoyable for adults, if not more so. Younger readers would possibly miss many of the subtle nuances of the work.\n\nAt first, the switching of viewpoint from omniscient to first person was a little awkward. Cole, the father of twins, is reading a book to them that is written by his father, Jake. The book he is reading is told in first person, and relates a tale from Cole's childhood. The portions featuring the `adult Cole' become scarce after the first quarter, though, making for a smoother read.\n\nI felt that having Jake write his book from a first person perspective, but relate in detail events he was not personally privy to, gave the story an unrealistic feel. Yes, the tale is a fantasy and, therefore, not realistic at all. However, this aspect leant a fictional quality that is negated later in the work.\n\nCole's explanation for why he did not call Jake \"Dad\", or something similar, was bothersome to me. The story did not really explain why or when Cole switched to calling his father by his name. I figured that he must have called him `Daddy' when a baby as the adults would have ensured this. His brother, Sean, calls Jake, \"Dad.\" So, the explanation Cole gives his sons seemed like something contrived by an adult to earn points with his kids, rather than something based in reality, especially given the story he reads to them with his father's part in it.\n\nAlthough the story takes place mostly in the `dream world', it is pointed out that Sean and Cole have physical bodies there and can be hurt or killed. However, when Sean breaks his leg, he still manages to run, jump, climb ladders, etc. I tried hard to overlook this and succeeded for the most part, thinking that perhaps his leg wasn't actually broken, just sprained or something. However, being told that Sean still limps as an adult reinforced the idea that the leg was broken.\n\nThis was a fairly fast paced novel with many action sequences. I especially enjoyed the stories injected into the storyline. They were a good fit and very interesting.\n\nOddly enough, my favorite characters were the cows from the trampoline scene.  I don't know why, but that image just stuck with me.\n\nCharacter Development: 4 Stars\n\nJake is a very well-developed character. The reader can really feel his emotions coming through. I have to admit that I found it difficult to feel much sympathy for a man who abandoned his children, but sympathy did come into play for him being a widower.\n\nCole could have been developed more as the reader really doesn't get much explanation for what he is really feeling. As a child, we understand that he loves his brother, but we don't get a feel for how this boy feels about having his mother die and being abandoned by his father. This is not expressed well from the adult Cole's viewpoint, either.\n\nSean is very well developed from the childhood view. I did wish that he would have made an appearance as an adult, but, even though that never happened, I was still satisifed with the development of his character.\n\nWriting Style: 4 3/4 Stars\n\nThe writing style of Mr. Marlowe had a wonderful flow to it that kept me enthralled throughout. The descriptions were vivid, bringing the dream world to life.\n\nAside from a very few dangling participles and awkward sentences, the structure was outstanding. The dialogue was realistic and engaging. The action sequences were also very nicely done with no confusion for the reader. I could actually see the action unfolding in my mind as I read (especially those cows).\n\nEditing/Formatting: 4 3/4 Stars\n\nThere were a few too many editing errors to refer to this as `professionally edited'; however, it did not fall very short.\n\nThe formatting was excellent.\n\nRating: PG\n\n-------------------------------\n\nFor more information and reviews, including commentary by authors, be sure to check out my blog.

Hold on tight to your hat and your wits as Marlowe takes you for a wild ride on the roller coaster of his rich and effervescent imagination. The book will keep your mind whirling between its artfully described nightmares and its exhilarating and boisterous heroism, while it stops short of stimulating true nightmares. You'll be delighted to meet the character who proudly declares \"By the age of ten I had awakened myself from a dead sleep with laughter so often...that my mother took me to a psychologist...\"\nFortunately you can read this delightful adventure by daylight or lamplight, unlike the magical Book of Dreams that holds the bones of the main story and can only be read by starlight.  Marlowe is a first rate storyteller who intertwines adventure and fantasy with thought provoking revelations. Sprinkled judiciously throughout the book are brief supporting stories which will equally delight and enlighten.\nWhile \"Sleepwalker: The Last Sandman\" sits comfortably in the same niche as the works of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, Marlowe holds true to his own unique creative vision. I think you'll agree with me that Marlowe delivers  \"...a happy ending that gives me exactly what I want, but in a way that I never expected.\" And that's a promise.", "label": "good review"}

I found myself becoming quite fond of many of the characters, and was sad for the book to end.  Never fear, though, the end leaves room for a sequel.\n\nThe ONLY problem with this book was the editing could have been just a little better.  There were about a dozen words misspelled, and some sentences with a couple of words transposed.

Though not entirely original, Tom's tale is well-paced and suspenseful, with the exception of the last few chapters, which dragged a bit, with unnecessary details and flashbacks that didn't contribute to the story. There were times when I almost gave up and quit reading - I admit that I go overboard pouncing on mistakes I find, from typos to inconsistencies and implausibilities in the story, stubbornly refusing to finish a book over obvious or egregious errors. I caught on to some apparent discrepancies, but plot exposition neatly accounted for most of them. It was tempting to skip to the end as the pace got sluggish (the flashbacks were getting tedious and I just wanted my questions answered), but I didn't, and it was worth the effort to keep reading. The problem with writing a review for this particular story is that I don't want to give away any of the plot twists or revelations. The plot twists are inventive and although I had a general idea of how the mystery was going to turn out, the end still held some surprises. There is some foreshadowing of the final reveal, but the author holds enough back so that even the most astute reader can't guess exactly what's coming, but not enough that a novice reader will feel misled or cheated.

{"words": "This is probably the hardest book review I'll ever write.  As an author myself I always preface my reviews with the information of whether I know the author or not.  I've \"met\" Larry Enright on Facebook, Twitter and a variety of other forums.  I love his wit and sense of humor.  I've interviewed him and didn't take offense to his comment that my writing career was inspired by a Rabid Dog (\"Old Yeller\").  And I'm not a professional reviewer.\n\nWhen I told Larry that I had purchased his book he emailed me and told me it was \"Different\", and he hoped I liked it.\n\nDifferent would be one way of describing \"Four Years From Home\".  Most people assume since I write dark, not-so-cozy murder mysteries that my taste in literature runs the gamut of James Patterson, Tami Hoag, Kay Hooper, Patricia Cornwell and other mystery writers with a penchant for murder and mayhem.  They would be right to a certain extent, but I also loved C. S. Lewis.  The first time I read \"The Screw Tape Letters\" I was amazed, thrilled and awed by a work of literary art so deep, and so exquisite  I almost felt I should chop off my fingers for even considering myself to be an author.  \"The Screw Tape Letters\" was different.  A book that inspired great passion in those who read it, and those who attempted to read it and burned it as blasphemy.  Growing up in the Bible belt I naturally assumed it would burst into flames as soon as I opened it, or at the very least I would be stricken with some horrible malady for reading such \"trash\".  It has a place of honor on my bookshelf as being one of the true literary arts of my time, and the exact opposite of what I was led to believe.  That's all I can say about it without giving you spoilers.\n\nSeveral years ago a movie came out called \"Sixth Sense\".  Millions of people watched this movie before I did, but out of millions of reviews not one person gave away the spoiler.  That fascinated me.  It was definitely \"different\".  And millions of people kept that secret religiously.  There were minor clues along the way, but so intricately weaved into the story that you missed them.\n\nWhich brings me back to \"Four Years From Home\".  A work of literary art which I believe will inspire passion within each reader.  You will love it - or you will hate it.  Or perhaps like me you will love it and hate it (which I can't say why without giving away a spoiler).  Within the pages of \"Four Years From Home\" Mr. Enright has weaved an intricate model of human hopes, dreams, fears, strengths and weaknesses.  The brilliance of the human mind, and the frailty of the human mind.\n\nTom Ryan is a Legend In His Own Mind.  Much like every child and artistic adult who grew up in an atmosphere that allows the imagination to develop and grow.  Reality is just a figment of our imagination to be bent, changed and shaped to our will.  But somewhere deep inside, perhaps at the core of our existence, deep within the soul lies a reality we cannot bend; we cannot change or shape to our will.  A reality we can only at best attempt to run away from and escape.\n\nI can't say more without giving away a spoiler, which is why this was a very difficult review to write.\n\nOVERALL BOOK - 4.5 Stars\n\nI gave this 4.5 stars instead of 5 because I found at least 5 typos in the book were words were omitted from a sentence and in one case transposed in a sentence.  For a debut novel this is minor, as my own traditionally published first book had 7 typos.  When I brought this to the attention of my publisher the comeback was, \"Patricia Cornwell's new book has 28 typos in it.\"  My comeback was, \"I'm not Patricia Cornwell.\"  As authors we have a responsibility to our readers.  As self-published authors that responsibility, in my humble opinion, increases.\n\nCHARACTERIZATION - 5 Stars\n\nYou are immediately drawn into the Ryan family through Tom's internal dialogue, and through interaction with his mother, father, sisters and brothers.  You're given a clear-- at least according to the legend-- concise \"picture\" of the family and their strengths and weaknesses.  They each become someone you feel you know intimately.  Especially Harry.  Sweet, special Harry.\n\n  Although some may consider this a backdoor approach into characterization, it worked for me.\n\nPLOT - 5 Stars\n\nThe plot is \"different\".  If you're a traditional mystery follower who expects certain things to happen in order, you may be slightly disappointed.  But the plot is unique.  A true literary art, as it is subtle, and perhaps somewhat hidden in the Legend's mind.  And the purpose of a mystery is to lead the reader down a path of intrigue, throwing out subtle clues and yet revealing nothing that will allow you to grasp the conclusion--therein, Mr. Enright has excelled.  I, as a mystery writer, applaud myself on being able to figure out early on \"what's going on\".  That didn't happen here.  I was tempted many times to move to the end of the book, but as with all books I enjoy I denied myself that pleasure and kept turning pages.  Searching for the clues that would reveal the end.  I was astounded.  I would never have guessed the ending.\n\nThis was a difficult book to review because I loved it, and I hated it, and I wanted to tell you why, but much like \"Sixth Sense\", that would reveal far too much.  You may find yourself a little irritated by Tom's obsession with (oops, can't say, because that's a spoiler), but if you like \"different\" then I truly believe you'll love this book.  A fantastic debut novel, and one I'm glad I didn't miss.", "label": "good review"}

One reviewer mentions an Epilogue, which appears to show up as Chapter 14 in my Kindle for PC, version 6 display.

{"words": "With the storyline taking place in Washington State, The Hunt provides a very entertaining read. Linell Jeppsen does an expert job at bringing her characters alive - including the vampire, even though this is no way near your run of the mill vampire story. Just ask the spirit walker.\n\nIn reading this story, I found that the storyline so engaging, many a time, I found it easy to forget I was reading a novel instead watching movie playing out in my mind. And there is no doubt, if someone was looking for a novel that's extremely hard to set down once you've started, this is the one to get!\n\nMy recommmendation - buy it and start reading, or maybe I should say, mentally watching it today!\n\nJonathon Waterman - author of the Kindle eBook, \"The Question\"", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Once again, Ms. Jeppsen weaves a mesmerizing tale that is difficult to put down. I was pulled into this story early on, and was astonished at the imagination the author infused into her writing. The vampires in this story are fully realized, unique creations. These entities have existed and evolved throughout the ages along-side Homo Sapiens; powerful, secretive predators of man. Now, facing likely extinction due to mankind's relentless poisoning of the environment, there has a arisen an insane, yet forceful and charismatic leader of an outlaw band of rogue vampires. This group despises humanity, and is ruthless as it leaves an unprecedented trail of destruction in its wake. The past and the present intertwine as the drama unfolds in spectacular fashion. In the present, a loving couple and two heroic men become caught up in the age-old battle.\n\nThere were a few times when I got confused by the time jumps, but the story never lets up. I never had time to become bored as each event propelled the action forward. This story is unlike any I have read before. Complex relationships are exposed, and an entirely new, intriguing mythology is revealed that becomes wholly believable in the context of this novel.\n\nThis book was given to me by the author in return for my honest review.  I have received no other compensation.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This is a story about a group of 'rogue' vampires who have been exiled from their clan and have been running wild for hundreds of years. Their leader, Raphael is sent to reign them in. Then we learn about a young, hardworking couple who just want to camp in the mountains for a few days of R&R and run into trouble. The stories intersect, which made the book interesting and intriguing.\n\nThis book started off great. The author tells a good story and we got a clear picture of the characters, both personality wise and physically. This book tells about 3 different stories which come together at the end - which I liked. The trouble I had with this book was with the jumping from different time eras, and then back to the present. A date at the beginning of the chapter would have probably helped the reader better because it started to get too confusing. There were also a lot of typos :( I did like the ending though.\n\nI would say this book is about 3.5 stars, could have been 4 with some proper editing.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "IRREFUTABLE was my first exposure to Dale Roberts's writing.  I'm a fan of thrillers and police procedural novels and the book description intrigued me.  I found much to like about the storytelling and much to dislike as well, so the book rates a solid 3 stars in my opinion.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n* Some significant story elements disappeared...and would've been a powerful player.  Without giving too much away, what about the firefighter's case? Will he see justice? Also...it's implied wife's death may have had something to do with *this* case...but it's never evaluated nor properly addressed.\n* Very shallow point of view: We're in Alex's head and know he had what he calls 'an affair' after his wife's death...but when it's revealed *who* the 'affair' was with, it's a rip off.  The reader should've known at least a hint more far earlier than that bomb was dropped.\n* Chronic use of weak verbs, abundant misuse of grammar (dialogue excluded), etc.\n\nPOSITIVES:\n* The ending had some serious tension as everything unfolded\n* Apparently the police procedural elements and DNA testing elements are accurate--the author did his research\n* I enjoyed it enough to finish it.\n\nSensuality level: PG-13\nLanguage: PG-13", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "A very creative plot kept me reading in spite of the grammar and usage errors. Almost all dialogue was written incorrectly: [\"I don't know.\" He said.] rather than [\"I don't know,\" he said.] An editor would certainly have corrected these and many other errors.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Irrefutable is a light, quick, easy read but offers nothing special.\n\nOur heroic detective struggles to cope with the murder of his wife (2 years ago), being a single father to a teenage daughter, and to somehow overlook his feelings for the ADA who clearly has her eyes on him.\n\nThe big \"twist\" was obvious to me no more than halfway through the book.\n\nThis isn't a bad book, but there are certainly many better things to read.", "label": "bad review"}

The clues are all there, but I kept on reading not to find out who the evil one was but to see how the father-daughter relationship developed and healed, how the very damaged man, who lost his wife two years earlier but still wore his wedding ring, healed.\n\nSPOILER ALERT: I did not really believe the detective, who was so gun shy of relationships would ever hook up with the nurse. He didn't even like her as a person, so why would he? For this reason I gave it only 4 stars.\n\nOther than a couple unbelievable scenarios, due to the characters as presented to us (such as, this character would not do THIS), I did truly like it and will read other books by this author.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This book was an easy read, but had some spelling errors. Only reason I gave 4.5 instead of 5 was  you pretty much knew about 3/4 of the way through \"who did it\" it was just you didn't know why. I like my ending to be a surprise.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I thoroughly enjoyed Irrefutable. It was something of a detective/mystery novel and had some very good foreshadowing, as well as some interesting plotting, keeping you guessing. Every time you think you're sure of the culprit something comes up that makes you doubt yourself, right up to the conclusion. The book does end a bit abruptly after all of the build up, but the plot arc is resolved at the end, so there were no dangling threads to leave the reader wanting.\n\nHonestly, this isn't even the type of book I'd normally enjoy, I'm usually more about Fantasy and Sci-Fi, so this was quite refreshing and I'd definitely recommend it.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I read a book purely for entertainment. I can live with a few grammatical errors. This book was full of twists and turns and shocks and surprises that I almost didn't go to work when I was supposed to. I was at the point where I really hated to put it down. One thing I really appreciated about this book, unlike many I have started and discarded, is a person really gets to know the character before being introduced to more. This alleviates a lot of confusion. There are some books that have too many unimportant characters that I've had to go back a few pages just to try and figure out who they are talking about and what their importance is. Not this book. All the characters play an important role. Also, there weren't a lot of wasted pages describing unimportant things that really have no bearing on the plot. Too many books will waste pages describing in detail a sex scene or history from a past life that has nothing to do with the story. Yep, this is one of my more enjoyable books that I've read.", "label": "good review"}

All of mine thus far, and I do this every weekend for the past month...have been a free large pizza.  On top of all of this, you get Papa rewards, so every 25 Papa Points, you get another free large pizza.  You can't go wrong.  And the pizza is phenomenal.

It works well cold or warm, though most people tend to prefer it heated up.  You can also do what my grandmother used to do and saute porkchops and then simmer the cooked chops in the saurkraut before serving.\n\nWorks well as a side to most beef or pork dishes and, obviously can be spooned onto hot dogs or be served with sausages.  Go on, try some of this at your next BBQ!  Sure, you can buy cheaper saurkraut--or go to the trouble of making your own--but I think this version is well worth the price.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Last year I purchased this product on a hunch at a local discount store(TM)at a tremendously discounted price. Now I am hooked. Works wonders on fish, but also terrific on potatoes, rice, eggs, chicken, steaks, Italian dishes and in all sorts of casseroles. It is a delightful medium grind blend of salt, black pepper, parsley, garlic, onion, lemon peel and green peppercorns. The mixture is a bit heavier on salt than I would like but I use it sparingly as it is quite potent on the other spices as well.\n\nI like to mix about a third cup of spice with a cup and a half all purpose flour in a baggie which I refrigerate for at least a few days. The spice flavors the flour which I then lightly sprinkle on fish or meats before pan grilling in a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a cast iron skillet. The result is a beautifully browned, light, crunchy, low fat, flavorable crust surrounding a wonderfully moist fillet of salmon, orange roughy, tuna, chicken or even rib eye steak.\n\nFisherman's Wharf really kicks up homemade potato salad, scrambled eggs and homemade chicken salad. I have mixed it with mayonnaise to spread on ham, tomato and lettuce sandwiches, BLTs and leftover turkey and fresh vegetable wraps. It also makes a quick and tasty salad dressing using olive oil and apple cider or balsamic vinegar. The uses for this wonderful spice blend are limited only by your culinary imagination.", "label": "good review"}

Try some with some fig cake, or some quince paste, or drizzled with olive oil garnished with rosemary..  Serve with a fino sherry, manzanilla, or any number of red wines (depending on age of cheese), and you are guaranteed a winning combination..  Sliced, melted over a great burger, with a roasted red pepper and a hearty glass of earthy zinfandel = heavenly joy..  Cube and marinate in Spanish olive oil is also a treat... I have had no problems with iGourmet so far, so I can't comment on their customer service - all of my orders have been shipped quickly (1-3 business days), without issue.  Their Manchego is much better than I can get at the local gourmet grocery stores.  They have great specials and offers, so I have to count myself as a big iGourmet fan.

The cookies are good sized and come in a nice variety, and they're definitely moist with a 'fresh baked' look, feel, and taste to them.  When not on sale I think they're rather expensive, but for the price I paid (25% off regular price) I think they were worth it.  My only real complaint is that the gift message was printed in small font at the bottom of the packing slip; not a single one of our kids noticed it, and we got quizzical messages from them asking if we were the ones who sent them the cookies.  A separate card or note taped to the top of the tin would have been a much better idea for the gift message.  So, if you're sending them as a gift you pretty much need to let the recipient know that you're sending them on your own as they most likely won't notice the gift message and be left wondering who sent them the cookies.", "label": "good review"}

So, I said to hLL with that!  I'm gonna buy some spa quality products that had an aromatherapy benefit and we'd just give each other the Spa Day!  And it would only cost 1/6th the price for all the products I purchased, including FHF Chocolate Facial (we both loved it), The Naked Bee Orange Blossum Honey Body Lotion, 80 Acres Blood Orange Oil and last but not least FHF Honey Heel Glaze.\nThis scrub is heavenly and smells just right.  I tried to get products I could get past my Manly Man.\nAfter using this scrub on each other in the shower - we fell asleep!  That's sensual - right?\n\nYou may think that a couple that's 55 years young would have benefitted more from a spa tech doing our Spa Day, BUT we put a date on the calendar to have the same type of 1/2 day together in exactly 4 weeks.  On top of that we have ALL the product we'll need for at least 6-7 \"Home Spa Days\"!\n\nWe had SOOO much fun as this salt scrub was exactly the right mixture of salt and oil.  I was very pleased with having found the right combination of products.", "label": "good review"}

Anyway, I'm so glad this hose and regulator is available on Amazon- this length is so difficult to find. It looks exactly like the original that came with the grill, it was easy to install, and my grill is functional again. Also, the price was reasonable ($29.99 + $4.99 S/H). I hope it's durable.

Both bags had their edges over the side while the tea steeped. When I used my fingers to pull them out, the glue-sealed one didn't feel hot at all; the t-sac was super hot.

When I feel the need to clean up I just pour a little water from a water bottle on the cloth and mix in a little soap.  This has always worked great and can be reused a few times if kept in the ziploc.  I bought the Tender Fresh Bath Wipes because I was looking for something to do just as good of a job with the ability to dispose of the product as well as eliminate the need to carry a small quantity of soap.

They didn't really leave me with that clean feeling and no way does one wipe cover your entire body.  With the size of the pouches I'm not really saving any space opposed to just a wash cloth and a little soap.  I suppose I'll use the rest of them but I don't plan on buying them again.  They would do fine in a pinch but I prefer the soap/cloth and water method much better.", "label": "bad review"}

The lids are thicker, the pot bodies are heavier, and the handles are more comfortable.  These pots and pans put brands like All Clad to shame.\n\nYes, they are made in China.  Only All Clad, which now makes their handles and lids off-shore too (they don't tell you where) and Vollrath are made in the US.  All Clad is no better than Cuisinart (which would be my second choice, and a lot cheaper) or Calphalon, now discontinued, in the clad cookware category.  And All Clad is ridiculously expensive, which in my opinion is completely unjustifiable, not to mention that their handles are as uncomfortable as they come.\n\nIf I didn't care about looks I would have gone with Vollrath, but the Le Creuset are very attractive (for pots and pans).  The new handles are thick and easy to grasp.  The finish is impeccable.\n\nHighly recommended", "label": "good review"}

First, the anonized aluminum heats quickly and evenly.  Actually, unlike most non-stick pans, this allows you to get it hot enough to properly brown ingredients.  Also, since it has metal handles, you can also put it in the oven or under the broiler.  Cheaper pans have plastic or rubberized handles that can melt.\n\nExcept for being metal, the only thing I don't like about the pan is the handle.  It has this art deco styling that actually makes the pan twist in your hand if the handle is a bit wet.\n\nAlso keep in mind, the non-stick coating on the Simply Calphalon line is not as thick as the Commercial, Professional II, and One non-stick lines.  So it will wear out in four or five years with regular use.

{"words": "Well, not everything I did was a mistake but there were more than Id like to admit. I do a lot of my own building and am making a lot of repairs to my current house and a log cabin I have. When I did a lot of roofing & siding work I assumed water would flow down and away so thats how I built everything. Along comes winter and the dreaded ice dams and now water flows uphill and under everything to then leak into the living spaces. I pulled some vinyl siding off to put on an addition and after only a few years enough water had gotten behind the siding and even the house wrap that it rotted away some large sections of OSB. I found the source of leaks to be where water ran down the sides of some window J-channels and where a sloped roof met an outside wall. I pulled off everything, made the repairs and then put all the trim back with healthy does of this sealant and the leaks are now gone and ice cant push up under it. I also use the clear around my wood stove pipes & roof flashing and it seals them tight so no water running down the pipe onto the stove when strong winds are pushing heavy rains. Im putting flashing over all the exposed wood fascia and this stuff ensures no water gets under it. if you vinyl siding you are likely getting water damage near the windows so don't assume that because you don't see it its not happening. Ive no gone through about a dozen tubes of this stuff over the past few years and never had a problem with it and have stuck a large nail in open tubes and since its flexible the nail comes out easily and the product is still usable.

After that, it is supposed to remain somewhat flexible like silicone, it does not.  It is gummy and easily punctured with indents appearing randomly even after your smooth bead has begun to dry weeks later.  Second, it shrinks more than any other caulk I have used.  Supposedly the clear shrinks more than the other colors, but I would never use it again anyway so I don't know.  What I do know is that it sets into a thin, and I mean ultra thin layer that is very difficult to get scrape off, which you will most likely do once you see how much it shrinks.  I even set up a dehumidifier to help the curing since it was used for a basement window.  (Two of the uses written DIRECTLY on the tube).

{"words": "I've had this steam cleaner for about 6 weeks and have found it to be an excellent addition to my cleaning tool arsenal. It does have its limitations, however.\n\nThe positive features is that it's easy to setup and use, and the compact shape makes it easy to find a place to store it when you're not using it. Setup is a snap - just attach the handle using one screw, and the manufacturer is thoughtful enough to provide an extra long, thin screwdriver since the handle screw is recessed. Nice touch. Also comes with a lot of attachments for pretty much anything you'd want to clean (grout lines, counter tops, floors, windows, BBQ grills, etc.).\n\nThe biggest plus is the price. I've looked at steam cleaners for years, but was always put off by the steep price tags. Some of the high end European models run $1,500 or more - for that kind of money, I'd rather pay someone to clean for me! So, a low price is a big plus.\n\nBUT, this low of a price means you're not getting the functionality of a high end machine. For example, the steam is pretty wet, and you'll also get a big dribble of water when you start up after pausing for a few moments. The tank is rather small, and you can't add more water without letting it cool down first. The attachments are OK in terms of function, but wear at a fairly fast rate. Build quality is good for the price paid, but you'll need to take care that you don't damage the wands since they are all plastic.\n\nAll in all, however, I'm happy with this. It makes it much easier to clean grout lines on my kitchen counters and floors, which is the main reason I got it. Again, it's not magic - you still need to put some work into it, but it's much, much, MUCH easier than using a scrub brush. What works well for me is to spray on some grout and tile cleaner first, let it set for a moment, then hit it with the steam. Wipe up with a clean microfiber towel and move on to the next section. I can do an entire room in the time it used to take me to do a small area with my trusty scrub brush.\n\nI've also have had good results using it to clean soap scum off tiles and shower doors, getting in the nooks/crannies around faucets and toilets, and cleaning drips/spills in the oven and on the range top. Light to moderate dirt/grime comes up with just steam. More intensive messes (or ones that are very greasy) need to be sprayed first with a spray cleaner (409, Fantastic, or whatever brand you like) to help the steam do its work.\n\nAnd remember, it just sprays steam - it does not suck it back up like a carpet cleaner. Keep a towel handy to wipe up the water and loosened dirt. Microfiber works best, but any absorbent rag will do.\n\nCouple of points to keep in mind:\n\n1) Use distilled water, especially if you have hard water. A build up of scale/mineral deposits will kill a steam cleaner very quickly.\n\n2) Wear ear plugs if you're working in a small room (such as a bathroom). The noise level can really get to you after 20 minutes or so.\n\n3) There's another model made by McCulloch that is exactly the same as this except that it has a slightly longer hose and a different colored casing.

{"words": "Before reviewing this item I should explain how I came to use it. I was reading a recent special issue of Popular Woodworking Magazine entitled \"The Ultimate Guide to Tablesaws 2004\". In this magazine I found the article \"19 Step Tune-up\" by Paul Anthony. This article explained a lot to me and really emphasized the importance of keeping your tablesaw (and other tools) properly adjusted. He explained the many components of a tool that can be checked/calibrated using a dial indicator. I assumed throughout the article that he was probably using some $300 model that would forever be out of my reach. Imagine my surprise when he revealed that he was using the Grizzly dial indicator with magnetic base attachment, and that these items are precise and affordable on every budget!\n\nNow for my review: Grizzly shipped my order in their usual speedy fashion and I have to say I am well pleased with this purchase. Once you hold this tool in your hands you understand that it is good quality without being frilly. The construction seems perfectly adequate, and my tests show this gauge to be quite precise as well. Within minutes after setting up my dial indicator I was able to determine that the aging blade on my tablesaw was no longer flat and needed to be replaced.\n\nAll in all, this is a smart buy that will allow you to fine tune your tools and check precise calibrations without hurting your pocketbook one bit.", "label": "good review"}

The only place I could notice any difference in quality from a more expensive one was in the dial indicator itself and the magnetic base.  The actual dial indicator seemed a slight bit more flimsy and not as durable as pro grade ones and the base's magnetic clamping force seemed a bit less but this was still fine for my use as I only needed this to setup a one-off automotive ring and pinion gear swap.  Most importantly it seemed accurate enough.

{"words": "I bought this for woodworking, primarily for setting up my jointer and adjusting the jointer knife height.\n\nIt came in a thick plastic case, which is more than I expected. It could've been padded, but since I didn't expect a case at all I can't fault it too much.\n\nAssembly was easy and the instructions were very clear and not Engrish-y at all, unlike most stuff like this. The instructions were clear, to the point, printed on thick stock and included lots of pictures. Way better than what you usually get here.\n\nThe machining on the base is clean and pretty much flawless. Smooth surfaces are smooth as glass. *Very* heavy. Feels like quality, more than the cost would suggest.\n\nWhen placed on my cast iron jointer bed, the magnet holds solid as a freaking rock. Almost impossible to move.\n\nI tested the accuracy with feeler gauges (zeroed out on a table, then slid the gauge under the measurement rod). The measurement was so close to the value on the feeler gauge that it was probably due to human error while zeroing it out to the table's height and not error in the tool. Even so it was (by my eye) no more than 1/10,000 of an inch off, and more like 1/50,000 to 1/100,000 of an inch. Accuracy is not a problem here, I think.\n\nThere are lots of adjustments, included one I *love* and didn't expect. The middle of the horizontal rod has a micro adjustment screw. As you loosen and tighten it, the dial moves up and down by tiny amounts. It lets you insanely close to the surface of an object. The action is smooth and easy.\n\nSo, if the unit is so great why is it three stars. Well, three stars isn't a horrible score, but there's a severe quality control issue. The unit I got has one serious flaw. The dial came WAY off of 0. By default the gauge reads around -10 thousandths. It is impossible to adjust the measurement rod to zero it out on the zero mark, but you can adjust the actual measurement markings - so I brought the zero to the needle instead of vice versa. This isn't a perfect solution - you can't zero out the \"hundredths\" gauge (the one in the middle), and the whole face is tilted over since 0 is in the top left instead of at the top.\n\nIt seems like you could insert a washer between the top of the rod and the body of the gauge, and if you used the right size washer you could adjust the needle back to 0. It already includes one thin metal washer and a rubber o-ring. I don't have a tiny diameter, super thin washer to use for this, and I shouldn't have to. It really should have come calibrated to 0. I contacted Grizzly support to see if there's a secret way to adjust the needle but haven't gotten an answer yet.\n\nIf it turns out that the unit is easy to fix, or if they can make it right otherwise, then this is a 4 star unit, maybe more like 4 1/2 star. I'm not really sure yet if I want to go through the hassle of a return, since it does work really well otherwise.\n\nThere's also no way to \"tare\" the unit beyond the hundredths place. You can rotate the measurement scale so that zero is wherever you want, but that only works for a single rotation of the needle. You can't zero the center \"hundredths\" dial. This isn't a big deal since I got this to deal with thousandths of an inch, and zero'ing out is just a shortcut so you don't have to do subtraction. Still, it is something to think about.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "There's a lot to like about the Grizzly G9849 Magnetic Base/Dial Indicator Combo.  The base is substantial and the switchable magnet holds it strongly to any steel or cast iron surface.  There are enough rods and clamps to make it useful in many situations.\n\nThere were a couple of issues that prevented me from awarding 5 stars.  The first one is that the bolt that holds the dial indicator to the rod clamp is quite difficult to tighten.  There is no screwdriver slot or socket head, so the only way to tighten the bolt is by using your fingers on the round, lightly knurled, small diameter head.  It's difficult to get your fingers between the indicator body and the rod to exert enough torque to keep the indicator solidly in place.  I may try to grind a screwdriver slot in the head so that I can use a tool on it.\n\nOne of the rods has a 'micro-adjuster'  in the center of it that is supposed to let you make small adjustments in the indicator position.  I find this feature to be pretty useless.  The joint is unstable, moves too easily, and it can screw up your measurements if you're not careful.  I usually avoid having the micro-adjuster in the setup by moving the indicator to the same side of the adjuster as the clamp that joins the 2 rods.  I would prefer to have a single, solid rod and will probably get one in the future.\n\nThe base is decent, but it would be more useful if there were more than 1 tapped hole in it.  I would like it if there were 1 or 2 more tapped holes, in other faces of the base.\n\nOne more thing.  If you are looking for an indicator to measure the runout of precision spindles, this is not the best one to choose.

These are well worth the price.\nUPDATE: What I said above has been tested now.\nPart 1:  I built a 200# 4ft. X 8ft. plywood work table and installed 6 of these assemblies to make it light and easy to roll.  Loaded it is about 250 to 300# max.  The wheels can't handle it well at all.  The problem is not the wheel itself, it is the chincy metal materials they used.  Soft, flexible, and bends rather than turn on the rollers, even on a flat new cement floor.  Sad. Data: 300# by 6 rollers = ~ 50 # each loading.... pretty over rated huh?!\nPart 2:  I made a small cabinet for the Sander I bought on Amazon, and I used 4 rollers to ease the locating of the tool in my shop.  Weighs total about 100# with the sander: works perfectly.  DATA: 100# by 4 wheels = 25# per wheel.  Obviously, typical China Junk.... very overrated.  Listed to handle 220# loads each, and at 50# each they begin to fail.\n\nDerate them by about 400% and you are just about right.  If you must have 50# or more on them the metal is just tooooo soft & cheap.  Otherwise, just great.", "label": "bad review"}

It's AWESOME.  It's not so thin that you can't control it--it won't seep all over your project, and it dries quickly enough that you don't need to clamp most projects.  And, boy, is it effective.

{"words": "One of the biggest issues with 3D printing, outside of printer reliability, software stability, and finding the right combination of speed and extrusion rate is build volume.  I have a Makerbot 5th Generation and as LARGE as the machine appears to be, the total build volume is probably about 1/5 the machine's total INTERNAL bulkiness.  DIY printers are usually not much larger, unless you are a SERIOUS builder.\n\nAnyway, printing small things like brackets, fan covers, or little things is not a big deal.  What if you wanted to build that cool Iron Man mask, or the full life-size suit?  That would be super cool!  But these printers just don't have the kind of build volume.  I'm at the point where my designs are too large for the printer and I need a way to extend the size of my parts without extending my machine or buying something bigger.  After searching the Internet for some sort of clue, I came across this, and I decided to try it.  It's not a lot of money, but it's also not cheap, but I did do my first test today (with PLA).  I did not sit there and wait for it to cure so I don't know exactly how long it took, but about an hour later, the two test pieces that I glued together are now one piece.  Trying to pry the smaller piece away resulted in \"breaking off the tabs\", per-se.  There is no gassing or rather, no vapor burns.  I simply used the \"drip\" that occurred when I snipped the bottle tip.  It went on the first piece rather heavy and I didn't think it would turn out well.  It turns out, it went on like a small pool of water, then I placed the smaller piece.  About an hour later, the pool of glue vanished, like there wasn't any glue.  Now, they are just two pieces of different color PLA stuck together.\n\nI think I found a winner for PLA 3D printed parts.", "label": "good review"}

Be very careful in cutting off the tip to the absolute smallest opening possible.  I keep a bottle of this and the super thin filler and use them constantly. Of significant importance is that this brand has a very good cap seal. The only time I have had a bottle solidify on me was when I did not snap it on all the way. Experienced SG users know what I mean. If you can remember to keep the cap snapped on this is also the cheapest way to buy SG.

Graphic and children's reviews on the blog typically feature two or three images from the book's interior, which are not reproduced here.\n\nNote that I don't really do stars.  To me a book is either worth reading or it isn't.  I can't rate it three-fifths worth reading!  The only reason I've relented and started putting stars up there is to credit the good ones, which were being unfairly uncredited.  So, all you'll ever see from me is a five-star or a one-star (since no stars isn't a rating, unfortunately).\n\nI rated this book WARTY!\n\nWARNING!  MAY CONTAIN UNHIDDEN SPOILERS!  PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!\n\nI am seriously going to have to quit reading certain categories of novel - novels which have titles like The Mermaid Chair and The invention of Wings. Anything which won a 'medal' is out. Medals are for heroes. I see nothing heroic and everything formulaic about the bulk of such pretentious novels. What else can we ditch? Well, anything which includes a female name in the title (with few exceptions), such as An Abundance of Katherines, and especially if the name does double duty, such as Looking for Alaska. Anything which includes 'dreams' or 'stars' in the title, such as The Fault in Our Stars. Anything which uses a bad or sad and weak metaphor, such as Paper Towns.\n\nOh, and one more which just came to mind: anything which uses a reference to botany or zoology as a comment on human behavior or the human condition, and then employs quotes from some book on the topic as chapter headers is right out. Which explains my attitude towards this novel. Fortunately, I got it on close-out, so I don't feel robbed.\n\nSince it was taking me forever to get to the print version I had of this, I actually pulled it from the library on audio disk so I could listen to it on my daily commute. I quite liked the reading voice at first, since it seemed to match the character, but I discovered after several disks that I probably wouldn't want to spend much time with this character if all I ever got out of her was this flat, rather monotonic slightly southern twang which wasn't so peachy after a while. Nevertheless, I managed to listen all the way through which was more than I can say for several other audio books I've had to endure!\n\nOne major problem with this novel is that it really doesn't know what it wants to be. On the one hand, its a rather unconvincing tale of a young teen's escape from an abusive father. On the other, its a white person once again coming to the rescue of black folks - because y'all know they sure cain't hep th'sel's. Talking of heroic, Martin Luther King was a hero, and he's rightly held in high esteem, but I think its really sad that he fomented an escape from a situation where one race appallingly abused another, while he never himself escaped another kind of slavery: that which goes hand-in-hand with organized religion.\n\nBut I digress. This novel is set in the summer of 1964, when Lily Melissa Owens, the fourteen-year-old, is a very effectively a white slave on her father's peach plantation. She has grown-up thinking she shot her mom (accidentally), and now all she has is a father, Terrance Ray Owens. For reason unexplained, she addresses him as T-Ray, and he punishes her by making her kneel on grits. The family has a house slave, Rosaleen, who is Lily's stand-in mom.\n\nOne day, while accompanying Rosaleen into town so the latter can register to vote, Lily observes Rosaleen perpetrate the idiotic act of 'repaying' verbal abuse from some local jerks by dribbling snuff juice over their shoes. She's arrested and tossed into jail along with Lily, who is shortly thereafter picked up by T-Ray. After T-Ray explains that Rosaleen is lucky to even be alive, Lily discovers that Rosaleen was beaten and is in hospital, so she engineers her escape, and they flee to Tiburon, a nearby town which holds an attraction to Lily because she believes her mother lived there.\n\nBy unbelievably miraculous once in a billion coincidence, Rosaleen and Lily end up at exactly the same house in which her mother did indeed stay for a while before her death. That's pretty much the entire story, but of course, the author puts the pedal to the medal and runs on long after this because clearly this is nowhere near enough angst, suffering, metaphor, and cuteness to make it medal material.\n\nSo we start with a young girl in a kind of slavery, and we end with her in a different kind of slavery, albeit less abusive. We start with her knowing precisely nothing about exactly what happened that fateful day when her mom was shot, and we end with her knowing precisely nothing about exactly what happened that fateful day when her mom was shot. We start with her living a sheltered life, and we end with her living a sheltered life. We start with her having a father and no mother, and we end with her having a father and no mother. Rosaleen starts out as a housekeeper, and she ends-up as a housekeeper. She starts out unregistered to vote, and she ends-up unregistered to vote.\n\nAlrighty then.\n\nQuite frankly I don't see the point of this novel.\n\nI would have liked it better had it not trivialized African American struggles by including two stories of a person of color being arrested for a legitimate offence, and trying to portray it as an abuse. There was no need to include the struggle for equal rights in a story which had nothing to do with that struggle, so I assume it was done merely show the story's medal, er mettle.\n\nThe story rambled far too much. It went on an on about trivial details which did nothing to paint a better picture or to move the story along. It was boring and predictable, and it had nothing whatsoever to do with bees (except in that Lily's middle name is from the Greek for 'bee'), beehives, honey, or secret lives.

When her black \"stand in mother\" is put in jail for insulting some racist men, Lily springs her out and they run away together.

And then she's furious to discover that it's Sheikh Hassan ben Khalifa Al-Qadim, her estranged husband, who has kidnapped her. Hassan had reluctantly given Leona this year away but now there is unrest in the sheikhdom, and Leona is at risk. Releasing Ethan, Hassan keeps Leona on his yacht and makes her promise to return to him for the remaining months of his father's frail life. Leona knows that once Khalifa dies, Hassan must divorce her. She cannot give him the heir that he needs, and the other ruling families are eager for him to take a second wife. Hassan will not divorce Leona, as she is his other half but will he bow to the pressure and take another wife as is his right, or will he give up his right to be Crown Prince.\n\nAnother emotionally powerful love story by Ms. Reid. Hassan's love for Leona runs deep and he will not give her up. Leona knows that he will lose everything if she stays and they do not have a child. Both Hassan and Leona are incredibly passionate characters whose love for one another wars with duty and responsibility. The secondary characters were richly developed as well. It was a pleasure to meet again Raschid and Evie from the The Mistress Bride and to meet Rafiq and Ethan who will have their own stories.

Or, the story itself is so well written that it is intriguing whether you know who did it or not, like the old Colombo tv shows.\n\nThis story really had known of those factors to draw me in, it was dry, extremely slow, and almost completely unbelievable. I found it hard to swallow that a person from the 'outside world', especially one of law enforcement, would be immediately tempting in even the most basic/innocent sexual way by anyone living in a somewhat closed and sheltered religious community of any kind.\n\nSo being very doubtful of the basic premise of this story, main characters whose inner/outer conversations and thoughts are very stilted, and knowing who the bad guy was almost immediately, left this a very boring and dry read in my mind.\n\nYou may find it different in yours though, thus the OK rating.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "Detective Peter Decker Is called upon to investigate a heinous, brutal rape of a young married woman in a remote yeshiva community.  Jewtown, the police, and gentile neighbours called it. Normally, very few criminal reports came from this quiet, orthodox area.  The police had been pursuing the Foothill Rapist who had committed crimes  elsewhere.  Law enforcement tried to make a connection, but religious beliefs, fear and embarrassment had sealed the victim's lips.\n\nPeter Decker is attracted to Rina Lazarus, a practising, young Jewish widow, who lives with her two sons in the compound.  Could Sarah Adler have been mistaken for Rina?  Rina recalled her dependency when she was with Yitzchak. That paranoia encircled her again  The invisible fear shackles had to be broken.\n\nThis Is a crime story, but also, the first of several novels written by Faye Killerman which feature the budding, and developing romance between an orthodox Jewish woman and an outsider. This novel lays the foundation for more Decker, Lazarus novels which pair the two as lovers, and intelligent crime solvers. The undercurrents are deep and freely flowing.  After the prep is apprehended, Marge said of Rina, \"She's bruised, but she'll be okay. She's s tough lady, Pete.\"", "label": "good review"}

She lived in an tight knit community centered around a school, and was one of the few who had outside experience.  When there was a brutal rape, she ended up being the one who worked best with the police.  The sense of community and its isolation from the mainstream plays a large part in the story.  Some of the locals are indifferent, some curious and some hostile to this community. There is mystery and even murder and hints at a blossoming love story.

Kellerman's next-to-last novel, Gun Games, focusing in considerable part on the relationship between 15-year-old \"adopted son\" Gabe, a musical prodigy, and a 14-year-old Persian girl and precocious opera lover, verges on being creepy. The Ritual Bath, however, is an engrossing introduction to Orthodox Jewish life combined with a solid murder mystery.

I strongly recommend that you read it first, or at least early on, in your exploration of the generally excellent Decker/Lazarus series.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "A mystery within a mystery. I would recommend this book, as it kept my interest, it was  well written and edited. Lots of intrigue. Unusual topic, rape within the Jewish community.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I liked the basic story of this book; the characters were well developed, I thought Rina and Peter both were realistic as were their conflicts with their feelings for each other. The crimes being investigated were a little convoluted to me, but only a little. I don't want to say too much, but there were some coincidences that I found a little too coincidental\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the changing POV, but that's a personal preference, not a flaw of the book. I prefer staying in the heads of the main characters, and there were a few times we were in the POV of some minor characters, which I found a little jarring.\n\nMy biggest problem with this book is probably with Kellerman's tendency to sprinkle the dialogue with Hebrew terms and not translate them. Most of the time, it's easy enough to figure out, at least generally, what's being said from the context, but there were times that it was still unclear, and there was no translation. I'm all for learning new words, I have no problem with that, but I just feel that if they're in a new language, the author should provide some kind of translation.\n\nShe did a great job, however, with explaining a lot of the concepts of the Jewish faith, concepts that I wasn't familiar with. The mikvah and the yeshiva, for example, are concepts that I was only familiar with in the broadest of terms, and Kellerman did a fantastic job of working her explanations of them into the story without it seeming like an info dump. I only wish that she done that with some of the terms, not just the concepts.\n\nI did like this, and I'll probably read more of this series, though not necessarily right away.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "NO SPOILER ALERTS HERE.  THIS IS A REVIEW, NOT A SYNOPSIS.\n\nThe Ritual Bath, a mikvah, is used by orthodox Jews to ritually cleanse their bodies and souls.  It is performed by immersing one's entire body into a pool of running (as opposed to stagnant) water and chanting prayers.\n\nThat hardly seems to be a place where danger lurks, yet, Kellerman uses the locale to introduce the reader to many of the features of her writing.  First, she employs Hebrew words, foreign to most of us. These seamlessly explain customs, holidays, and rituals. To her credit, they don't interfere with the dialogue that she skillfully writes. Second, her protagonists can seemingly never have a relationship.  Rina is a modern orthodox Jew.  Peter is a gentile Los Angeles police detective.  Third, the author turns an implausible idea into reality.  (No plot giveaways here.  (Read and enjoy it for yourself.)  Next, being set in L.A., an enormous metropolitan area, allows us to accept the diversity of cultures within the plot. Last, Kellerman's use of opposites creates the right amount of tension between her protagonists.\n\nSome mystery writers, such as Lee Child, write page-turners that are impossible to put down.  While Kellerman's plot turns, it lacks this edgy excitement throughout the book.  The dnouement, however, is well done.  She has more than one potential antagonist for us and the ending is surprising.\n\nThe portrayal of the main female character, Rina Lazarus, is strong.  The author has given her a firm voice.  We can picture her, she rings true. It is Peter Decker, the male protagonist, who is not fully developed.  He is somewhat like the TV detective Peter Falk played on the Columbo series decades ago.  At face value he is a less dimensional personality than Rina.  But, like that TV detective, there is more to Peter than we initially see.\n\nAs a first in a lengthy series, The Ritual Bath is a good introduction for the reader.  We learn about the characters.  Who they are, what their value systems and beliefs are, and how they meet. This back story is essential in understanding their motivations.  If you like serial writing and enjoy the familiarity of characters and settings, this story is a good place to start.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I've been reading a lot of World War II books lately and needed a break from the heavy reading, so I ordered up this book for my Kindle. I'd heard of Faye Kellerman but never read any of her books. I always like to start at the beginning rather than dive into the middle of a series. For one thing, when a series begins oftentimes the author's protagonists are fresh and more 3 dimensional. As time goes on, too many times in a series the author gets tired of their creations and simply write to satisfy their fan base. Anyway, in this book Kellerman introduces a duo that is definitely different from any other two protagonists I've seen...one is a detective in a sex crime unit, and the other is the female target of a crime in a yeshiva (which makes her a very religious Jew). This introduces the reader not only to a good mystery/crime but also to a chance to learn about another culture, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The history and the religious information made the people become more alive in the book, and a lot of the problems of the growing attraction between Decker (the cop) and Rina (the woman in the yeshiva) becomes more understandable when the rules and laws of the Jewish religion is explained.\n\nThe crimes involved are solved in due course, and the book is a satisfying read. My only complaint is the constant bad language. I'm not one for constant gutter language. I want to read another one of these, and I sure hope this isn't a constant trend because it will determine if I read the entire series, which I think I could enjoy otherwise...", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I have to admit, the first time I read this book, with such high expectations, I was pretty disappointed. I was expecting a story similar to her many other wonderful stories like my all time favorites, Ransom and The Secret.\nHer quirky sense of humor, her witty dialog, well fleshed out characters that you can't help but love or hate...just weren't present in this book. At least, not to the extent that we've come to expect and appreciate so much.\nI especially missed the development of the romance between the main characters. A man who marries a woman because he owes someone else a favor, not because he has any interest in her for herself; a woman who marries because she feels forced into it by her circumstances...doesn't make for a very good start, to say the least.\nI have to say that it was probably a much more realistic portrayal of marriage than her other H/R books. People rarely married for love in that time period. They married for title/land/dowry, and pretty much anything But love.\nHowever, I don't read her books for historical accuracy. I read them for great entertainment and pure fun!\nAfter giving the book another chance, I found that although it wasn't her usual \"formula\", and I still missed the sense of humor she's so noted for, the story was a little darker than her usual stories and gave less opportunity for humor. There was some here and there, but I felt that the story would have been much improved if her character had shown a cute sense of humor and been a little less perfect, a little more \"human\". A woman who had real faults and made a few real mistakes would have been much more sympathetic and appealing.\nOverall, I feel that it's a story well worth reading, but if this is your first time to read a Julie Garwood book, do yourself a favor and read \"Ransom\" or \"The Secret\" first. Once you know that she really is a wonderful author, you may be able to enjoy this book for what it is; a pretty good read, but one of her less than stellar efforts.", "label": "bad review"}

This book is tied to The Secret and Ransom and because I loved the characters in those books I was curious to see just how the three books were connected and just how bad it was.  To my surprise...I really enjoyed the book.  Yes, the main characters don't really \"get\" together until very late in the book but the story was beautiful.  I for one don't read Julie Garwood books solely for the romance but for the historical content as well.  It all becomes magical to be able to be transported into that period of time. It was entertaining, it had substance, it was a nice love story.  I think that people should definitely give the book a chance.  To each his own...everyone has their own opinion...for example I didn't like Rebellious Desire or the Prize for that matter but I still gave it a chance and those books weren't terribly bad I just didn't care for it.\n\nAt any rate give the book a chance.  I'm glad she is still writing even if the characters have some of the same descriptions...smelling like roses, smelling like leather, herculian men, viking men, all the women stood up to their intended...But it's all nice in its own way in my opinion.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "This was the most complex and convoluted storyline of the three books in this series, and I almost lost interest, but I hung in there and I'm so glad I did. This turned out to be a very good book, but it does require a bit of patient whimsy on the part of the reader, at least in the beginning.\n\nLike the other two books in the series, Garwood sets up the tale by telling us the back story of the main character; in this case, Princess Gabrielle, a member of the now defunct royal family of a mythical country called Saint Biel. Given in marriage to a highland laird by King John, Gabrielle is in the highlands for her wedding. But the machinations of a couple of ruthless barons leaves Gabrielle in disgrace and at the mercy -- and under the protection of -- another highland laird.\n\nThe hero is pretty stock, but what's great about this story is the personality of Gabrielle. She is not a weak or silly woman, but someone with excellent self esteem who faces adversity as it comes. She isn't overly maternal, or a healer, or any of the usual female traits that makeup a character of her type. She is unique in my experience, and this is so refreshing that I slowed my reading in order to savor it. It's fun to watch her manage the laird without confrontation. She constantly surprises him, and his reactions to her make him a more interesting character. Gabrielle is very original and likeable and I would love to see more female characters created in her image.\n\nGabrielle also has a close relationship with her four St. Biel guards, who have been with her since childhood; they are great characters in their own right, and her interactions with them are fun to watch.\n\nAll in all, a very entertaining read, maybe slightly more complicated than the first two books, but still very good.

I am wondering how to rate. I did enjoy the book, just not as much as the others. I felt the formula was off.\n\nI felt the book was off because the Colm & Gabrielle pretty much didn't even meet each other until the midway point in the book. There was such a confusing back story and all the other mini plots that my head was spinning. I just wanted Colm and Gabrielle to meet and it was getting frustrating that it hadnt happened yet. Afterall in all the other books, Garwoods characters were married near the beginning of the book. (which I loved)\n\nAnother big difference I felt from the previous novels and how Shadow Music was written was the writing style in general. Garwood has really great prologues. Shadow Music also had a great prologue but it felt like by the 4th chapter I was still reading a prologue and waiting for the story to actually begin. The story of the battling barons was a great set up for the conflict but it just felt to long.\nThe battle where Liam was injured and Gabrielle and her guard saved him was great but I still didn't understand why the need to keep it a secret was such a big deal. I initially thought that Liam was going to be the hero of this story not his brooding Laird brother.\nThe entire Abbey chapters where Gabrielle was disgraced started really to frustrate me. I wanted them to meet and it still hadnt happened yet.\nMoving forward to Gabrielle and Colm finally meeting was such a let down. I was thinking to myself it took chapters and chapters to get here and that was it?\n\nI did like that Gabrielle was a bit different of heroin than the other female characters. I like the Garwood doesnt just write the same characters over and over with just a name change to make them different. Having said that, I found myself getting frustrated with Gabrielle on many occasions. Her stupidity (naivety) made me want to shake her. I am not exactly sure why Gabrielle and Colm fell in love. I didn't connect with them. I felt the love was a bit forced and I felt that I was being told to feel this or that instead of automatically loving the couple.\n\nOkay what I did like was the anticipation of the climax. I did like Gabrielles guards. I loved the 5 yr old twin boys being added to the story (Garwood does excellent children characters) because this story needed some sort of comic relief.

{"words": "When I closed this book, I asked myself \"What the heck did I just read?\"\n\nI have not enjoyed Julie Garwood's foray into contemporary romantic suspense. Not at all. So when I saw that she was not only returning to her historical romance roots but also to her favored setting in Scotland, I was thrilled.\n\nThis was the same woman who has written The Bride and The Secret and so many other funny, warm, poignant romances with great alpha heroes and quirky fun heroines. I have read and re-read all of her early paperbacks from the 80s and 90s. She's on keeper shelf.\n\nSO I settled down to get into this book. The beginning starts just fine and I am thrilled. But then something crazy happens. The characters seem like lifeless retreads of some of her previous characters. The plot, likewise, is a meandering mess that tries to recall the glories of The Bride and The Secret and fails miserably.\n\nThe villains are pathetic and laughable (and they were not intended to be) and truthfully, you never really understand why anyone does what they do.\n\nI seriously skipped whole passages, thinking...wait...it has got to get better. Right? It never did. She includes a spate of secondary characters that are obvious attempts to add color and texture, something I am usually very grateful for. But these too fall flat. Nothing about this book worked for me on any level.\n\nAnd can someone please tell me why the heck this book is entitled Shadow Music? The plot, the characters nothing alludes to this. Yeah, at the end of one chapter deep into the book while a bad guy is about to get killed he sees his killer's shadow and then hears the 'music' of a sword being drawn from a scabbard. That's it. That is all there is that has even the most distant connection to the title. I kept wondering as I was reading what the title referred to. Things like this just piss me off.\n\nIf this were the first Garwood book I'd ever read, I'd've simply dismissed it as a generic piece of romance fluff and I would not have bothered to look the author up again. But I know what this author is capable of and I am severely disappointed because I know she can write better than this.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "There were so many bad reviews about this book, that I almost didn't read it, having enjoyed the first two books in this series so much I didn't want to ruin it. I am so glad I did read it, and I loved it as much as the first two books. I am honestly confused about everyone's displeasure. Some thought the story took too long to get going, but I didn't notice undue delay and felt the extra background information was needed for the story. Others felt Brodick's character was unrecognizable, and though I admit he had softened a bit from the first two books, I felt it was already happening at the end of the second book and largely due to being married. One of the things I really liked about this book was Gabrielle's guard and their interaction with Colm and his men. There is something enjoyable about the banter between a group of men that are close to each other, particularly when they are all protecting the same woman. I enjoyed the same thing in the second book with Brodick's guard. I enjoyed Colm and Gabrielle, and felt they were likable, engaging main characters.

Each is followed with a short summary of the chapter. The book was originally written in 2009 and definitely shows that Trump hasn't changed his position on topics over the past 7 years, and his personality seems the same and appears to have been written in his voice. It does give a better insight into his way of thinking in business and explains several rumors heard about him over the years. He doesn't hesitate to use names which allows the reader to get a very vivid picture of what he's talking about. Definitely worth the $2 spent. Trump appears to be a ruthless businessman, but he's also full of words of encouragement. Glad I took the time to read it.

I've legitimately spent so much money on their brand and, overwhelmingly, their products have been great -- but this is really the worst top coat imaginable.

I'm surprised someone said that this will level out streaky polishes underneath it, because for me, it definitely doesn't. The time before this I used it, it also left tiny bubbles on the surface of the nail, between the coloured polish and the top of the base coat. It goes on looking deceptively fine and then just creates nail disasters. For me, it didn't cause polish to shrink away from the tip (which is great) and initially provided a fair amount of sheen, but  I'm looking down at the nails I did yesterday and they're absolutely covered in dents. I used the top coat to help prevent the colour getting nail marks and whatnot while I slept. It honestly looks 100 times worse with the top coat than it does when you just apply nail polish, wait a while, and then go to bed. This top coat's truly terrible.

{"words": "Just did my nails two days ago and I now have a big chip in the middle of my index finger.  This polish isn't very durable at all.  It's not even as sturdy as Essie polishes.  This is a beautiful sea green color that I thought would be perfect for spring/summer.  It goes on a little dark, but is still pretty.  It's too bad it doesn't stand up to even the slightest wear.  It went on a little streaky, but once the second coat was on, it was fine.  This is the first Zoya polish I've tried.  Before now, I haven't been impressed by the color selection, but this nice green color spoke to me when I was in Ulta (and there was a sale to boot, lol!).  I don't like having chips and usually do my polish as soon as they start to appear.  But I definitely don't like it when I've babied my manicure and a huge gouge appears in the middle of my nail!  Not cool at all.  I haven't used one of the 5 free formulas before and so far, I don't like it at all.  Give me the chemicals that make nail polish last a week please!  I guess I'll go repair my chipped nail now, and hopefully that'll be it for a while.  I recommend this polish only if you're sensitive to the chemicals in nail polish.  Otherwise, try Whim, Butter London, Dior or even Essie.  All of which last longer than this Zoya polish.", "label": "bad review"}

I've had it on for a few days and it still looks wonderful.  (Granted, my toenail polish usually lasts a long time.)  It went on smoothly and wasn't drippy.  The brush is a bit narrow but that really helps with edges and smaller toes.  This was opaque in two coats and it dried quickly.  I put it on over a base coat (blues and greens sometimes stain my nails) and finished with Seche Vite fast dry topcoat.  It has a lovely shine when dry.\n\nThis is a five-free polish (as are all Zoya polishes).  Although my bottle was kind of old, this went on smoothly and wasn't sticky or goopy.

{"words": "This review is for \"Blair,\" since there are multiple colors listed on the same page.\n\nI really like nailpolish colors like this.  I have quite a selection in the oxblood/deep red/wine/reddish purple family, including glitters, cremes, shimmers, etc.  So I expected to love the color of this even before I bought it!\n\nI find the color in the bottle looks pretty similar to the color you see when it dries (and also to the image on the screen on the computer I'm currently using).  So you know what you'll be getting.  I'd say this had cool/purplish undertones for a red, it's really more of a wine color.  It has a subtle shimmer and looks really nice with a high-shine topcoat (I used one from Seche Vite).\n\nThis went on more smoothly than most polishes I've used lately (over an OPI base coat).  It dried quickly.  I used two coats to get it fully opaque, but depending on your preferences, you might be able to get by with one thick coat.  I got only one tiny bubble that you can hardly even see (I've had much worse bubbling problems with other polishes).  So far, I don't have any shrinking or chips although that might change when I clean house later tonight.  But about 18 hours after application, it still looks nearly perfect.  I'd say this was one of the better-performing Zoya polishes I've used in that regard.  (I have quite a few of them.)", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "This review is for \"Ki,\" a purple/green duochrome.\n\nZoya was having a sale and I couldn't resist this one.  It is unlike anything else I have.  I feel like it is a true duochrome (and not just using the name to attract attention).  You can see the shifting between the green and purple in the bottle, but also on your nails.  Depending on how I hold my hand with respect to a light source, my nails look either purple or green, with maybe just a suggestion of the other color.  It's pretty cool and I can't stop looking at it!\n\nFormula-wise, this is one of my favorite Zoyas.  It did require three coats to become opaque, but it was super easy to apply.  It was not drippy and the brush was fairly narrow (not wide like those Nails Inc. brushes), which I felt gave me a good level of control.  It dried quickly (helped along by some Seche Vite fast dry topcoat) and has a nice shine and a smooth, even surface.\n\nI've had this on for about a day now and I don't see any chips.  (My nails are fairly short.)  I did have to do a lot of cleaning yesterday evening and normally that would cause chips, but it didn't this time.\n\nIn the end, I like pretty much everything about this.

It goes on very thick. If you put it next to other brands of nail polish (e.g., Essie, Butter London), you can see the difference - Zoya tends to look a bit more sloppy.\nIs it worth it? I'm torn.

The color is gorgeous and looks great in the bottle. It just did not go on great due to the majority of the bottle being glitter (including \"bar\" glitter).\n\n*layer 1 - Some parts of my nail had glitter, others didn't. It looked awful so I decided to go for another layer.\n*layer 2- Now Twila is starting to show up blue and glittery. It looks kind of weird though like there is no polish, just glitter. The glitter is hanging off of my nails in a couple of spots since there are glitter \"bars\" in this polish.\n*layer 3- A few spots looked like they needed a third layer, but after trying the first nail I gave up on layer 3. It was too clumpy from layer 2 to fill in the spots.\n\nThe night that I painted my nails I was wishing that I hadn't. I was losing glitter everywhere and they just felt wrong. My nails were clumpy, bumpy and frustrating. By the end of day 2 my nails were highly chipped and it was time to remove the polish. While this one looks gorgeous online and in the bottle, it is not efficient. Skip it.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Found this at Ulta after considering an online purchase of Zoya (after reading reviews).  Gemma is an army green color, and in the bottle, you can see the contrast dichroic-type effect of pale purple shimmer.  However, once it's on the nails, that dichro effect is lost.  It simply looks like a shiny army green.  I think that the difference between regular ambient light in a room (or outdoors) and the pale purple shimmer is simply not great enough to show a difference.  If you're looking for army green, go for it.  If you're looking for dichroic effect, keep looking.\n\nOn the plus side, I did my nails last night and have spent about 10 hours typing since then, and they show no wear at all.  Right now I'm using OPI's Natural Nail Base Coat and Top Coat, but I have the Zoya products on order (Ulta didn't stock those).  I'm hoping the all-Zoya combo will give me a super long wear.  I'll come back and report in when this one starts to show wear, and also after my first all-Zoya manicure begins to show wear.  So far, I recommend!\n\nEdit.  Zoya took a  really long time to ship out my stuff.  My Gemma manicure lasted 10 days with only minimal edge wear (which only I could see; people talking to me couldn't tell).  I was bored with the color, so I went to Ulta and bought \"Sarah\" (a metallic red) and did that with Orly's \"Top 2 Bottom\" base/top coat.  So far this has lasted 5 days and is not showing wear.\n\nOf course the Zoya stuff showed up the next day.  So I stripped the \"Sarah\" manicure off my right hand and used the Zoya Anchor base coat, 2 coats of Sarah, and the Armor top coat.  This has lasted 4 days so far (no wear).  I'm really impressed with the longevity of this nail polish.  I used to be an all-OPI girl, but when their stuff started chipping within a day I decided it was time to look elsewhere.  Zoya is now my top stop for new nail polishes.  Just wish they'd either ship faster, or that Ulta would stock 100% of their products!", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "The best thing I can say about this magazine is that I didn't have to pay for the subscription; I bought it with air miles. Good thing, too, because this magazine is NOT worth its price, either off-the-rack or via subscription.  Want to keep up with your favorite celebrities? The \"news\" in this magazine is nothing more than a collection of rumors.  Want fashion advice? The most you'll get here are photos of celebs wearing something and what it is.  Most of the fashions and cosmetics are, of course, waaayyy out of the price range of the average reader.\n\nThe stories are rumors you can get much cheaper via supermarket tabloids, or \"quotes\" from a \"source\" that's supposedly \"close\" to the celebrity, or paragraphs of what the person \"might\" do, based on trends or what their celeb pals have done in the past.  Usually these are incorrect.  A few months ago I the magazine gushed about Princess Kate's pregnancy with twins, and how Buckingham Palace \"should confirm\" it soon.  Today the cover squeals that Kate and her sister Pippa are both pregnant, Kate with a girl and Pippa with a boy.  I won't hold my breath over it.\n\nSubscribe to US or PEOPLE if you want intelligently-written articles about celebs and others in the news.  The magazines don't source stories on gossip and rumor, and are written by reliable reporters instead of paparazzi, which I suspect is the case here.  OK! was anything but, and I'm sorry I wasted air miles on it.", "label": "bad review"}

I didn't appreciate his gratuitous digs at China, but more importantly, the article meandered on forever without any useful detail or statistics.\n\n\"God Help You. You're on Dialysis\" was much better, though covering the topic of those unfortunate enough to require kidney dialysis. Every year, over 100,000 Americans start, and 25% die within 12 months, a fatality rate the writer report as one of the worst in the developed world - despite spending about $77,000/patient, believed to be more than any other nation. Meanwhile, our government has kept secret clinic-specific data that could help patients make better decisions (Medicare agreed to release them after this article), and the two corporate chains dominating the system (DaVita, Fresnius) together earn about $2 billion in operating profits/year. More than 80% are for-profit.\n\nThe author reviewed inspection reports for more than 1,500 clinics out of 5,000 from 2002-09, finding reports of filthy or unsafe conditions in almost half the units checked. Sixty clinics had at least five citations for prescription errors. Consequences are seldom meaningful - just 16 clinics were closed from 2000 to 2008.\n\nItaly spends about one-third less than the U.S., and only about 11% die each year, vs. 20% in the U.S. Patients have more than 5X as much contact with their physicians as in the U.S. Patients start dialysis sooner than in the U.S.\n\nThe 'good news' is that Medicare is now moving to improve dialysis care.\n\n\"Your Child Left Behind\" reports on a study by Hanushek that compares individual American states with foreign countries, looking at 15-year-old students ranked as the best at math in each location. Only 6% of U.S. students perform at the advanced-proficiency level in math, lagging some 30 other nations, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Finland, Switzerland, Belgium, and Netherlands, in that order. OECD nations trailing us included only Portugal, Greece, Turkey, and Mexico. Massachusetts ranks as the best state, behind 16 other nations. Even restricting U.S. students to whites or those with at least one college-educated parent put New York below Poland's all children, and Illinois' pupils with at least one college-educated parent performed lower than all students in Iceland, France, Estonia, and Sweden.\n\nOn a per student basis, we spend more than all but Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Norway.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I started reading The Atlantic in 2004. Back then The Atlantic provided insightful and interesting articles covering Iraq and Afghanistan, and occasionally included some fiction.\n\nIn the last five years, I have witnessed a slight decline in the quality of this magazine. No doubt this is due to the decline in advertising revenues of this magazine. The Atlantic has scaled down and axed the fiction section from its monthly publication. Fiction is now published annually. Recent covers have included tacky and cheesy headlines designed to capture attention and are more appropriate for a tabloid than The Atlantic. Examples have included\n\n- The Britney Show\n- The Passion of Alec Baldwin\n- If Kim Jong Il Used Facebook\n\nDespite it's recent shortcomings, I would recommend the Atlantic to anyone interested in reading about global affairs, finance, culture, and politics.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "First off, let me say that The Atlantic is one of the finest, most intelligent and original magazines on American politics. It's essential reading and an absolute bargain for the money. As complementary readings, I'd suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-New-Yorker/dp/B00005N7T5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The New Yorker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Wilson-Quarterly/dp/B00005NIP3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Wilson Quarterly</a>.\n\nThe pros of the Kindle version over the paper version are that you get instant delivery of each new issue, it costs half as much per issue (and you pay per issue rather than annually), and it's more environmentally friendly, given that you've already bought a Kindle. The cons are that you miss out on some excellent graphics. Also, though the Kindle version is well-organized, the linear progression of one article after another, uninterrupted, inevitably grows tiresome. After subscribing to the Kindle version for about a year, I've decided that it's not quite worth it. I'm switching to the print edition. Of course, the same content is also available on the magazine's website at no cost, but the paper version is much easier on the eyes.", "label": "good review"}

I read it while awaiting treatment at my dentist's office, while on the train or at a coffee shop. In 45 minutes, I have had my fill. It is otherwise not compelling in its originality or capacity.\n\nThe articles are better than most popular magazines. I enjoy Mark Steyn and Mark Bowden, but get tired of Christopher Hitchens' proselytory writing tone.\n\nOccasional issues have been dumbed down, are feel as if they are being geared for the Entertainment Tonight crowd.\n\nThe Atlantic is a good read in short spurts, but inconsistent over the entire issue, I now only buy a couple issues a year, at most.\n\nAnthony Trendl\n[...]", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "The Atlantic is an intellectual magazine and one that I have been reading on and off for many years. This magazine is best known for its political/current events/social articles that tackle some tough issues of the day and it delivers most effectively when it's offering some commentary on world events and social issues and these are the articles I turn to first when I read The Atlantic. I like the political articles best, but there are plenty of other non- political yet very thoughtful articles in each issue.\nMost every article in The Atlantic is thoughtful and well- written. Look closely at the authors of some of the stories in this magazine and you will notice some high- profile names on more than one occasion. Christopher Hitchens, Mark Bowden, Eric Schlosser, and others are known to contribute an article or two in each issue of The Atlantic. These writers, and others like them, are ready to offer their take on some of the critical issues of the day.\n\nThe Atlantic certainly offers some interesting, thoughtful, intellectual articles and one fact that sets them apart from those found in most other magazines is that the featured articles are often very long- sometimes exceeding ten pages in length. Most magazines shy away from articles this long because they know that most reader's have an attention span that is far too short to finish the entire piece of reading in one sitting. But The Atlantic is different. If the subject matter is such that an article needs to be ten- plus pages in order to thoroughly cover everything, then The Atlantic is quick to oblige. I appreciate the excellent coverage but I must admit that some articles are almost too long. Even when I have an interest in the subject matter, I often end up stopping halfway through because I cannot hold my attention any longer.\n\nAnother section I like in The Atlantic is the book reviews section. To present a fair and balanced perspective, The Atlantic reviews new books from many different genres and I like that there are different reviews of varying lengths. One section of The Atlantic called Cover to Cover includes short summaries of many different books. These are nice when you don't have time to read a lengthy review of a book and just want the basics. But there are also some very long book reviews in The Atlantic, along with some advertisements for new books that include a short, 50 to 100 word summary of the book. I like reading the reviews, but I like this section best for its exposure to new book releases. It is like looking at a quick rundown of intellectual books and I have, in fact, discovered some very good titles from this part of the magazine.\n\nOverall, The Atlantic ranks among my favorite magazines and I look forward to some serious, intellectual reading in each issue. I admit that some articles are a tad too lengthy, but I still like The Atlantic for its intellectual stimulation and for its focus on current events. It's a very good magazine for cerebral types who like to read about politics and social issues.", "label": "good review"}

In other words, this magazine caters to an audience that is wider than I first thought, which I think is a good thing.\n\nI also like the current editor a lot - I think he does a good job of balancing the need to keep the magazine relevant / current with the desire to tie the new issues into the larger Southern Living legacy. He lets the magazine celebrate tradition without being overly stuffy or being overly resistant to change and/or modern tastes. In other words, the magazine keeps its unique voice but also stays fresh/current too.\n\nOne additional comment is that Southern Living always has lovely covers.

{"words": "I found a Cooking Light magazine from 2009 and tried their banana bars with browned butter pecan frosting. Can I say delicious (the bananas are roasted with brown sugar and butter first), but I think personally I'd about half the sugar. When they say light in this magazine they seem to mean reducing fat. So the recipe had 8.4g of fat but 35.1g of carbs . I think if they are going to say a recipe is healthier they should also reduce the sugar. So next time I'll remember how sweet the cake was and lower the amount of sugar to say 3/4 cup instead of 1 1/4 cup. Light to me at least seems to mean less fat AND sugar. I didn't play around with the recipe because I only had three bananas and couldn't afford to get it wrong on the first try. I'll try other recipes in this magazine if I find any in the future but I'll remember to pay attention to the sugar.\n\n~The Rebecca Review", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "This out of all the many versions of Jane Eyre has to be my least favorite...\nGranted Samantha Morton has  a very  adorable fairy/ Elfin like face like Mr Rochesters Description of her, but her acting has  no highs and lows. She stands up to Mr Edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers, seemingly no respect to her employer, which is not fault of  hers, the writing of the script is bad.... and so the direction. Ciaran Hinds  is totally over the top. He is so angry with no understanding, his eyes are  very lustful and at times  crazed.  He is not at all like the character  described in Brontes epic book of a very sad and  tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the  innocence and singular personality of earnest, honest and yet strong sweet  Jane Eyre that Charlotte Bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words.\n\n The over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical. To me there is no love, feeling  or chemistry here between the two actors just lust.... He seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl, and she though supposedy a virgin...  she dosn't act like one.\n Plus this movie  seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story Especially during Janes childhood. I do also miss the Gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the Dalton /Clarke mini series, which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story.\n\nIf you want to see great versions. I  highly rate the 1944 movie with Orson Wells though it is another abreviatd version, that movie truly captured the spirit and feel. It is moody dark and mysterious. Another is the fantastic Timothy Dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the  Brontes story.  Dalton's and Clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime!\n\nHowever if you are like me, see them all and make your own decision. They all have something to offer and most are entertaining...", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "I really like this version of Jane Eyre.  Fans of romantic/historical movies will enjoy the detailed sets and costumes as well as the high drama.  Fans of the novel will appreciate a script that's true to the book without ploddingly recreating it word-for-word or--just as bad--peppered with anachronisms in an attempt to make Jane Eyre hip and modern.\n\nSamantha Morton brings Jane's underlying strength of character to life and Ciaran Hinds, as Mr. Rochester, does very well with a character that can easily be overplayed to the point of silliness.  They are supported by a strong cast, including Gemma Jones as Mrs. Fairfax.  The overall production value is as high as the caliber of the acting.\n\nThis is a good, strong production, though I do wish that the DVD came with some extras.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This is a so so adaptation of the novel into a film. I suppose they had to cut certain plot elements out while creating a motion picture screenplay and I appreciate that. This is a MOVIE not a book in moving pictures. But still, there were a few things that could have made the film even more fantastic and wonderful:\n\n1.) The replacement of Mr. Brockelhurst as head of Lowood school would have been a happy incident in this dark film. It would have satisfied the desire for such a wicked man to get his just desserts.\n\n2.) There was no point changing the character of St. John Rivers who is supposed to be stoic and unemotional to this engaging, flirtatious character in the film. It only made her rejection of him bittersweet since he had been nothing but kind to her from the beginninig.\n\n3.) Why couldn't they show her coming into the 20,000 pounds from her uncle. This happy coincidence is something that can only happen in a film and they should have taken advantage of it. She can end up RICH AND HAPPY.\n\nThe plus side is that I suppose JAne's suffering is not as prolonged as it is in the book. There's just enough suffering to not make it insipid. Also, the actors who play Mr. Rochester and Jane do a really good job as do the rest of the cast. There is a lot of using the eyes and body to act not just words. I adored the music which made the whole thing really melodramatic and everything such a novel from such a literary period in such an adaptation should be.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "The William Hurt and Timothy Dalton versions of this movie were good. But, here's a Jane Eyre that I truly enjoyed. An orphan raised in an orphanage, arrives at Thornfield Hall to care for an orphan, and falls in love with her seemingly infallible employer. It is a classic that grips you since in the end, the characters overcome the worst and find true happiness.\n\nThe young Jane was fantastic with her willful impestuousness. Samantha Morton brought spunk and humor to her character and I found it refreshing. And, Ciaran Hinds gives a lighthearted yet dramatic performance which makes him the perfect, indomitable, unfathomable, mysterious Edward Rochester. The actors exquisitely portrayed the conflict of pain, love, and passion, so that this movie epitomizes what Bronte fans look forward to.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This was the first version of Jane Eyre I had ever seen and I enjoyed it very much.  There was a chemistry or \"passion\" between Jane and Rochester.  Samantha Morton played Jane better than anyone to date.  Jane had personality which I think she lacks in other versions.\n\nI thought Ciaran Hinds as Rochester was wonderful.  He was very close to how I imagined Mr. Rochester in the book.  Not handsome but rugged and likeable.  He did tend to be a bully somtimes and that was a negative but he also had a tender side that came out through his facial expressions in a number of scenes between he and Jane.\n\nA few negatives I found with the film are: 1. this version doesn't stay true to the book, much of the dialogue between the characters is rewritten, 2.  sometimes Rochester is a little too angry and 3.  I wish it were longer so that more of the book could be included.\n\nI loved the ending and had butterflies watching it.  I found the passion between the actors moving and can easily watch this version again and again.\n\nIf however, you want a version of Jane Eyre that keeps closer to the book, then the Timothy Dalton version (1983) is a better choice.  It too is very good but is a bit dated (I felt like I was watching a play rather than a movie).\n\nIdeally, I would love to see a production of Jane Eyre that is as well done as the A&E version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I'm not going to repeat the plot, nor am I going to go on and on about comparisons with the book.  This is just a critique on this version of JE.  I've seen the others, and this version isn't bad, it's hilarious.\n\nI've never laughed so hard at an adaption which is supposed to be a tragic but uplifting love story.  Oh, let me count the ways....  First, the Jane Eyre character, played by Samantha Morton.  I thought she appeared to be a bit of a vindictive, spiteful, co-dependent girl.  She is a \"Heather\" in Victorian dress.  However, I think she was the perfect for this version of Mr. Rochester.  Oh boy.....\n\nI LOVE Ciarn Hinds, I love his range, his voice, it's a doggone shame that the scriptwriter, director made his character laughable.  Yes, his mannerisms are cringeworthy, and his 'attraction' for Jane, bordered on sexual harassment.  The character's lust for life, and vigor appeared to be a bipolar disorder.\n\nThe part that made spit out my water at the TV screen, the scene after he and Jane first shared a passionate kiss.  After we hear Jane narrate how she imagined the kiss or that moment, here comes Mr. Rochester.  Jane addresses him as \"Mr. Rochester\", and he has an expression of perverted that only Austin Powers could love.  He whispers, \"Edward.\"  I was waiting for him to wink, wink, nudge, nudge and wiggle his eyebrows.\n\nIf you're down in the dumps, this version will make you shake your head and perhaps laugh it off.", "label": "bad review"}

The actors were fine, but the dialogue they were given was so trite that I found myself wincing through most of it.  The script lost a lot of the novel's \"punch\" and intensity.  This DVD is definitely going into the Salvation Army bin.  I couldn't sit through it again.\n\nMy favorite version of Jane Eyre is still the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton - good dialogue, fine acting, and great film score, plus at 311 minutes the original story remains pretty much in tact.\n\nI also love Timothy Dalton's version of Wuthering Heights - never a dry eye at the end of that one.  Beautiful, haunting film score.", "label": "bad review"}

I've watched many versions of this classic novel, and this is by far the worst.  Ciarn Hinds, who I usually love, plays Mr. Rochester as a raving lunatic, not a tortured man who's life has been turned upside down by an unfortunate mistake as a young man.  There is no chemistry between the characters and the dialogue/plot differs so much from the novel it is a travesty to call this 'Jane Eyre.'  I threw away this DVD after watching it.  A waste of $$$.  Buy the Timothy Dalton version for a true 'Mr. Rochester.'", "label": "bad review"}

Also, the acting was poor in my opinion. Samantha Morton was not very believable as Jane Eyre and the actor who plays Mr. Rochester was altogether unappealing. The two actors had no spark or chemistry to speak of, and the relation of love by Mr. Rochester later in the film is wholly unbelievable and poorly delivered. He ruins one of the best lines in the novel (the one with the bit of string tied to his heart and Jane's). Also, although Mr. Rochester is not handsome, this actor was just uglier than I had imagined Mr. Rochester to be. But, that would be of little account if he also did not portray Mr. Rochester as just plain rude. He ordered about Jane in a brutish manner, levied insults, barked out his lines and was very dull. Why Jane would be attracted to him (beyond being lonely and not having the company of any other man) is beyond me. The portryal of Jane was also a dull one and her constant voice overs were really annoying. A film is supposed to show us the story, not tell us the story. There was far too much telling of Jane felt or about her past, and far too little demonstration. I was told Jane loved Mr. Rochester, but from watching the film I found that very hard to believe. Jane also seemed to be rude and disrespectful on purpose, rather than observant and forthright as she is in the novel. She doesn't mean to offend, but truthfully answers questions and speaks her mind. The movie would have you think she is just catty. Also, she always looks so annoyed with Mr. Rochester.\n\nOverall, I regret buying this film. I wished I put my $5 dollars towards the William Hurt adaptation which more accurately captures the emotion and spirit of the novel, if not all the exact details.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "With two such fine performers as Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton, and with Charlotte Bronte's masterful story, I could not believe that this version of Jane Eyre would be anything but enjoyable.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  I think the problem lies with the screenplay. A complex story was reduced to 2 hours, which meant that key plot and character development had to be sacrificed.  Hinds and Morton just did not have enough to work with.  Stick with the Timothy Dalton version, it is far better.", "label": "bad review"}

Ciaran Hinds is perfect as Mr. Rochester. After seeing this movie I became a big fan of his. If you like good love stories this is a must see.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I can't say that this version of Jane Eyre followed the storyline closely.  Because of time constraints, large chunks of the novel had to be cut out or streamlined.  This includes not only some key plot points, but a lot of the best dialogue between Jane and Mr. Rochester as their relationship develops.\n\nThat said, I still think this is an enjoyable film, so long as you enjoy it in its own right and don't compare it to the book.  Both Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton commit to their roles with passion.  Like the characters in the novel, neither is conventionally beautiful; they are riveting because of the emotional force they bring to their parts.  At times, Hinds was a little too gruff as Rochester, but it never went over the top; he looked the part of Mr. Rochester and in my opinion acted it incredibly well.  And Samantha Morton is luminous - she may wear plain clothing and sport a ridiculous hair style, but she shines.  I did dislike some of the belabored dialogue the screenwriters introduced though.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I recently caught this on cable and was excited to see it; after all, \"Jane Eyre\" is one of my favorite books of all time.\nWhile Samantha Morton made an excellent Jane, I thought Ciaran Hinds was terrible as Mr. Rochester. He was far more blustery than smoldering, and the scene at which he screamed at Jane while she drove away disturbed me. He seemed more like an abusive boyfriend than a man overwhelmed with pain and passion.\nAlso, some of my favorite scenes were cut. Where was the scene where Jane went home to visit her family? She left and then came back again; we saw no part of her interaction with the Reeds, which was one of the best parts in the book. She also never learned of the inheritance left to her by her uncle in Madeira. And I agree with the reviewer who said that the part with St. John and Diana might have been left out for all the weight this movie gave it.\nOverall, this is not an awful movie. However, it is inferior by far to other productions, notably the version with Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "Yes, I've read Jane Eyre, for the first time when I was twelve.  And, yes, I liked the book.  But this movie isn't the book and I liked it as well.\nOne thing the movie did very well in the beginning was to condense years of abuse by Jane's aunt and Mr. Brocklehurst into a few key horrific scenes that also point out the affection that Jane felt for her friend Helen, the few kind teachers and later her pupils.\nCiaran Hinds as the hero begins with a great deal of roaring and bluster, but here and there are hints that this is a screen he uses to protect himself from the pain of intimacy.  The key to Mr. Rochester's character is in the scene in which he tells Jane about his \"grand passion\" and how he was betrayed by the woman he adored.  Juxtapose this against the first Mrs. Rochester's passion for him that overset her reason.\nSamantha Morton does a lovely job of portraying an innocent who is not ignorant of the darker aspects of human nature-- Lowood School taught her more than reading, writing and geography.  Her plummet into the pain of the truth and then her coming to understand the power of the passion that grips her is very well played.\nIf I want to re-experience my version of Jane Eyre I will reread the book.  That does not mean I cannot enjoy another interpretation of the story.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I must fervently disagree with the many positive reviews shown here, for 2 major reasons.  First, the writers took great 'liberties' with the novel that detract, rather than enhance, the characters.  The best two examples involve the main characters of Mr. Rochester and Jane.  In the book, Rochester is a brooding, singular figure who is very much a victim of the cruel plotting and vices of others.  But in this film version, he is cruel and vindictive in and of himself.  Vengeful, plotting, and profane, you have little reason to see why Jane would ever attach herself to such a worthless creature.  Jane of course does fall in love with him, but because he is so repugnant, the viewer can hardly see any reason why.  Thus, Jane is herself reduced greatly from a woman who loves unconditionally - -as was shown in the book- -to a strange, misguided young woman racked with a codependent psyche.  The second area in which this version is inferior to the book, and the other far superior film versions (particularly the William Hurt version) is its brevity.  It is only 90 minutes long.  It leaves out so many of the small aspects that would normally give vitality and life to the characters.  Being that it is such a poor version, this is not necessarily all that bad, but willing to give the film chance after chance to redeem itself, it falls terribly short on nearly every measure.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Jane Eyre is one of my very favorite books, so I simply cannot like a film version that leaves out important details.  I liked it when I first saw it, but had the nagging feeling that something was missing.  So I re-read the book, and discovered exactly what was missing -- about 1/4 of the book.  Among the scenes that were missing were the other reasons behind Jane's return to Thornfield.\nAnd then there's Samantha Morton.  I cannot think of a film where I liked her, so that is another strike against this version.\nSome have said that Timothy Dalton is \"too handsome\" to play Rochester.  Perhaps he is.  But he is such an incredible actor that I will forgive him. *grin*  I do appreciate Ciaran Hinds, and it pains me to say that I did not like him as Rochester. I read someplace that he hadn't read the book before making this film.  Well, it shows.  He rants and raves too much; there was no subtlety in his performance.  And subtlety is something Dalton understood in his performance.\nAn adaptation does not need to be a word-for-word translation from page to screen, but it does have to retain the spirit of the original for me to appreciate it, and this version does neither, so I cannot find much to like about it.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Well, I  just watched this movie today again after not seeing it for a couple of years and again I loved it.\nNo, it is not as true to the book as some other versions, but it captures the spirit and tells the story in a very compelling, moving-it-along way. I enjoyed the rapid transitions, cut-aways and voice overs. It tells the story of the novel in a most interesting way.\nI think Samantha Morton makes an excellent Jane Eyre. She really captures Jane's innocent yet vibrantly alive spirit. Morton exudes the very fairy-like, impish qualities that Mr. Rochester is always describing her as having in the book. I think she is the best Jane I have see portrayed although I do enjoy Charlotte Gainesborough's and Joan Fontaine's work as Jane as well.\nCiran Hinds did equally as well. I think the two actors really displayed the chemistry that existed potently between Jane and Rochester. This kiss under the tree was remarkable!\nThe settings and lighting in this version are much better than in the 1983 Timothy Dalton version. And although Hinds is quite handsome in Persuasion, he actually becomes the more unattractive Rochester in this movie. Dalton, although a powerful performance in the miniseries in which he played Mr. Rochester, could never really be considered \"ugly.\" Hinds is a more credible Rochester and very true to Charlotte Bronte's novel.\nI highly recommend and enjoy this version of Jane Eyre. Although not as true to the book as other versions, I think it included the most crucial scenes in a most convincing way. It was truly a fresh look at a classic and timeless novel.", "label": "good review"}

No sign either of \"He saw that the boy had inherited his own eyes as they once were: large, brilliant, and black\"--that's one of the most famous lines in English literature, for crying out loud!!\nI was more disappointed than I can say to see that Ciaran Hinds, so wonderful in \"Persuasion\", was so terrible in this. And Samantha Morton as Jane was even worse. There wasn't a hint that she had lived through the childhood Jane Eyre had to become the governess Rochester encounters in the mist.\nPlease, if you have never seen \"Jane Eyre\", don't make this sorry mess your introduction to that magnificient novel.

I thought that was perfect casting and that I would see something of the caliber of \"Pride and Prejudice.\" I was bitterly disappointed! What a travesty!\nMy main objection is that the scriptwriter decided she could improve on Charlotte Bronte. Instead of sticking to the words in the book as closely as possible, she completely rewrote the dialogue. What arrogance! The result is that both Rochester and Jane say things that are completely out of character to anyone that's read the book. \"I feel your passions are aroused\"? I found myself screaming at the screen \"he'd never say that!\"\nMy second main objection was how Ciaran Hinds was directed to play Rochester. I blame the director because I've seen Hinds in many movies and know the range of emotion he can display. In this version he was essentially one-note: he shouts all the time. The ONLY time he softens is in the bedroom with Jane after the fire. That one scene showed me what could have been, and only sharpened my disappointment with the rest. What a sad waste of what could have been a marvelous production.\nI did like Samantha Morton's Jane best of all the Janes (I've seen every version of this).

Morton as Jane Eyre confirms my earlier opinion from her performance in \"Sweet And Low Down\" that she is an actress to watch.  As far as faithfulness to the novel, I really don't demand that from films which are a very different creative medium from novels. The basic story has become a timeless classic, often copied but never equaled.  Jane is a poor orphan who becomes a governess for Rochester's ward.  He is a wealthy man with a beautiful estate.

{"words": "I started reading this book last week and decided to rent the movie. They only had this version of Jane Eyre and was hesitant to watch it because I had never heard of the actors before. As the movie started I noticed that  it skipped the beginning of the book (began at the red-room incident)and  spent more time towards Jane Eyre as an adult. When I first saw Ciaran  Hinds (Mr. Rochester) I thought - this man isn't very attractive and he is  really mean!  Jane Eyre will never fall for him! But, Mr. Hinds played the  role wonderfully and even I looked beyond his roughness and fell inlove  with the character!  Samantha Morton played a wonderful Jane Eyre and I  really felt the chemistry between the two throughout the movie.  I think my  favorite scene was when he was waiting for Jane to get back from preparing  for her aunts funeral and was very jealous.  And the ending made me cry!

{"words": "One of the greatest dramatic series of all time, Upstairs Downstairs (U/D) is about life at 165 Eaton Place in Belgravia, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in London.  It reflects the tensions between masters and servants, between different categories of servants, and between the existing order and those who do not fully accept it--servants who aspire to careers outside of domestic service, persons motivated by middle-class values, and the nouveau riche who respect money and power more than tradition.  Both upstairs and downstairs residents are influenced by British imperialism and xenophobia.\n\nBritish actresses Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins conceived U/D as a comedy focused on the downstairs staff.  But it gradually evolved into a drama about the entire household--both upstairs and downstairs.  London Weekend producer Cyril Bennett did not believe that U/D would be successful.  He held Series 1 off the air for six months, then chose to broadcast it at 10:15 on Sunday nights.  Despite this scheduling, the show became one of the most popular PBS programs of all time.\n\nThe household is headed by Richard Bellamy (David Langton), the son of a clergyman, who has married Lady Marjorie, scion of the prominent Southwold family.  As a political and social conservative, Richard attains high administrative offices, but, as a member of Parliament, he prefers to vote according to his conscience rather than the Southwold family's preferences.  Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) is imperious and aristocratic.  Their son James (Simon Williams), an army officer, is plagued by such bad judgment that we generally cannot sympathize with him.  His sister Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett) is idealistic and romantic, but unrealistic.  Her relations with the male sex always turn out badly, until (having left U/D after Series 2) she is said to have found marital happiness in America.  Following Marjorie's death, management of the household falls to James's new wife Hazel (Meg Wynn Owen), the daughter of an accountant, who is guided by different values than other members of the Bellamy family.  Marjorie's niece Georgina (Lesley-Anne Down) arrives in Series 3, with a sense of idealism and adventure.  After the war, Richard marries Virginia (Hannah Gordon), who provides companionship and support.\n\nThe downstairs staff is directed by the butler, Hudson (Gordon Jackson), who relies on discipline to preserve traditional standards, and discretion to prevent scandal, but can be sympathetic when the occasion warrants.  Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley), the cook, overcomes kitchen crises and follows household gossip.  Rose (Jean Marsh), the head house parlor maid, later ladies maid, is devoted to the family, but occasionally expresses dissatisfaction with her \"place\" in the system.  Under house parlor maid Sarah (Pauline Collins) makes up in imagination what she lacks in education; anxious to escape domestic service, she becomes a chorus girl.  Chauffeur Thomas Watkins (John Alderton) is something of a con-artist, but he evidently has genuine affection for Sarah.  Under house parlor maid Daisy (Jacqueline Tong) marries footman Edward (Christopher Beeny) and attempts to advance his career.  At the bottom of the servants' hierarchy is the kitchen maid Ruby (Jenny Tomasin).\n\nInterestingly, all the award nominations went to the downstairs actors, although it seemed to this reviewer that nearly all the actors put in strong performances.  Two personal favorites are Raymond Huntley's portrayal of the very formal, punctilious, and bespectacled family solicitor, Sir Geoffrey Dillon; and Jenny Tomasin's performance as the uneducated and unrespected scullery maid Ruby.  Tomasin took to heart Jackson's comment that there were no small parts, only small actors, and her rendering of Ruby may become a model for future actresses.  Fortunately, there are occasions on which Ruby knows more than the other servants, and when she shows initiative by leaving 165 Eaton Place to take a factory job, and by soliciting correspondence through a dating service--these events prevent Ruby from becoming a caricature.\n\nThe 68 episodes vary in quality; but there are few really poor ones.  The stories deal with a wide range of matters, including family relations, infidelity, divorce, inappropriate pregnancies, miscarriages, espionage, murder, suicide, casualties of war, politics, and the consequences of prosperity and depression.  Many episodes are connected to such real events as the death of Edward VII, World War I, the Silvertown munitions factory explosion, the 1926 General Strike, and the Stock Market Crash.  The producers gave great attention to verisimilitude -for example, consulting with Buckingham Palace staff regarding protocol for hosting the king's visit to 165 Eaton Place.\n\nMany viewers consider Series 1 (1903-1909) the least successful.  (Most of this series was not aired in the U.S. until many years later.)  It had a lower budget than subsequent series; and, due to a technicians' strike, the first half dozen episodes were filmed in black and white.  Writers, directors, and actors were still trying to set the parameters for the program.  As a result, this series includes several strange stories; and some characters (especially the footman Alfred), lack credibility.  Some performances are too loud, too demonstrative, and poorly choreographed.  Many of the stories in Series 2 (1908 - 1910) provide various perspectives on marriage; others deal with problems created by a superannuated nanny and by Elizabeth's suffrage activities.  King Edward VII is a dinner guest in one episode; and this series ends with his death.  Series 3 (1912 - 1914) witnesses the arrival of Hazel Forrest as Richard Bellamy's secretary, and her marriage to James Bellamy.  Lady Marjorie having died on the Titanic, Hazel assumes the management of the household.  She eventually overcomes downstairs resentment; but her middle-class outlook leads to clashes with Richard and James.  This series ends with the outbreak of World War I.  The war casts a shadow over Series 4 (1914-1918), which many consider the best.  The Bellamys take in a family of Belgian refugees, James Bellamy and footman Edward join the army, other members of the household take on war-related duties; and a local baker, of German descent, becomes a victim of anti-German hysteria.  The war impacts the household in various ways--the staff must dine on ersatz meat and potatoes, James comes home severely wounded, and the house is hit by a bomb.  Series 5 (1919-1930) deals with life in the 1920s.  Richard finds happiness with his new wife Virginia.  But old values are challenged, as the younger generation engage in wild parties and other reckless behavior, aided by such new technologies as autos, airplanes, and motion pictures.  As a result of the stock market crash and the Depression, both upstairs and downstairs residents must leave Eaton Place to start new lives elsewhere.\n\nIt has been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; and U/D has had several imitators, including Beacon Hill (1975), as well as a new&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Upstairs-Downstairs-2010/dp/B004N66XYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Upstairs, Downstairs (2010)</a>&nbsp;.

Consider the similarities:  In both the wealth comes from the woman's side of the family.  Both Richard (U/D) and Robert (DA) are in precarious financial situations:  When Marjorie dies, the family fortune goes to Richard's children.  Without a male heir, Downton Abbey will go to another branch of the family.  In both programs:  (1) family members die (or appear to die) on the Titanic, (2) the young men are involved in World War I (in each, the principal young male character, after being missing in action, returns home gravely wounded; in each household, one of the domestic servants suffers from shell shock); (3) a young female member of the family becomes a wartime nurse; (4) a young woman dies from influenza; (5) there is a downstairs romance; (6) there is a homosexual footman; (6) a male aristocrat refuses to take responsibility for a child he has fathered by a maid; (7) an adventurous young daughter gets into trouble from her involvement in the suffrage movement; (8) the cook is courted by an unworthy suitor; (9) the question arises as to who will fill in for the ailing butler; (10) the household feels obliged to dismiss an unsatisfactory nanny; and (11) the family suffers from making bad investments.  Well, you get the idea.\n\nThis 21-disc set provides several supplementary features.  (1) The production of each Series is documented in an accompanying program, featuring interviews with writers, directors, actors.  (2) \"Russell Harty Goes Upstairs, Downstairs\" (1975), in which talk show host Russell Harty visits cast members on the set shortly after the final episode was broadcast.  (3) \"Upstairs Downstairs Remembered\" (1996), narrated by Gareth Hunt, in which cast members give accounts of behind-the-scenes problems and accomplishments.  (4)  In \"Sandy's Last Stand\" (2006), composer Alexander Faris describes how he wrote the theme music, including the \"upstairs\" theme and the \"downstairs\" theme (\"What are We Going to Do With Uncle Arthur?\").  This includes performances of both the original 4/4 and the more familiar 3/4 versions of the upstairs theme, and the downstairs theme.\n\nUpstairs Downstairs was the product of 9 writers and 8 directors.  Hence, there are some inconsistencies in the details and in the portrayal of characters.  There are relatively few scene changes; and the program often has the feel of a stage production.  Images of many outdoor scenes, which were filmed with smaller cameras, have noticeably lower resolution.  The 2010 Acorn release, on which this review is based, is said to be better than the previous A & E versions.  But, like some other reviewers, I have experienced a few problems with it.  Several episodes freeze.  I have not had similar problems with other Acorn products. [See NOTE below.] A list of all 68 episodes, indicating the discs on which they were reproduced, would have been a very desirable addition to this set.  I have compiled such a list and attached a copy inside the jewel case for each series; this enables me to go directly to the appropriate disc for whatever episode I wish to see.\n\nBy informal count, Upstairs Downstairs was nominated for 17 Emmys and received 7, most significantly, 4 successive awards for outstanding dramatic series.  It was nominated for 9 BAFTA awards and received 2; and was nominated for 4 Golden Globe Awards and received 1.  It also received a Peabody Award, a Royal Television Society Award; and its theme song won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Theme From a Radio or Television Production.  The program could have continued beyond five years, but the actors, writers, and directors chose to end it.  Cyril Bennett, who had been reluctant to air the program in the first place, pleaded vociferously, but ineffectively, with John Hawkesworth that the program should be  extended  for another ten years.  Thus, there have been no further episodes of this outstanding drama.\n\nChristopher Hodson, who directed 14 episodes, described U/D as \"the sort of series that doesn't come along more than once in a lifetime.\"  Few would disagree.\n\n[NOTE:  The sticking problem seems to result from a spindle hole that is slightly too small.  Enlarging the spindle hole by as little as .001 of an inch with the aid of a round mini-file or fine sandpaper seems to correct the problem. Perhaps some other reviewer can explain why this is so.  Needless to say, be careful not to damage any other surfaces of a CD! ]", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "The Complete Series Upstairs, Downstairs is a beloved drama set between 1903-1930 in Great Britain at the London mansion of an aristocratic family and their staff of domestic servants. It contains 68 episodes on 20 DVDs, plus one DVD with quite a few bonus features The first season comprises 13 episodes and the first episodes seem spare, especially in the dialog--more like stage plays than video dramas of today's miniseries.  Later episodes lose that stagey-ness and become very involved dramas. Since the original series broadcast in the US did not include the black-and-white episodes,  I was not familiar with the development of the series and how it grew from a rather simple initial season to rather involved arcs. For that ALONE, I'd recommend this set of DVD's because seeing them all in series is fascinating. And I saw entirely new episodes (for me) as I'd missed a lot of the first seasons, being off at college and without a television for some years.\n\nI was also able to look at the opening titles with the drawings from \"Punch\" (A British humor magazine) and admire how the producers selected amazingly apt drawings to fit the particular episode.\n\nSome of the initial episodes, sadly, are recorded only in black and white due to a technicians' strike in the early 70's. It doesn't actually detract from the enjoyment, just makes it a bit sad we can't see the sets and costuming as they were filmed. The black & white are sharp and clear, but the color episodes can be somewhat lower in resolution. The colors can be dim as well, but it doesn't detract. The cropping is often odd. This is not a perfect conversion from the television to DVD, but it's adequate and probably a lot has to do with changes in technologies since the 70's and the early days of television-to-DVD remastering.\n\nThe extras are lavish:\n Extras:\n\n5-part documentary: The Making of Upstairs Downstairs\n24 episode commentaries\nUpstairs, Downstairs Remembered - with Gareth Hunt (51:50)\nRussell Harty Goes Upstairs Downstairs (30:00)\nSandy's Last Stand with composer Alexander Faris (13:15)\nSimon Williams and Alfred Shaughnessy in Conversation (22:50)\n\"Russell Harty Plus\" Interview with Gordon Jackson (6:40)\n\"Russell Harty Plus\" Interview with Jean Marsh (11:15)\n\"Russell Harty Plus\" Interview with Angela Baddeley (9:40)\n Alternate version of Episode 1 \"On Trial\"\n Essay by star and co-creator Jean Marsh\n\nIt's nice to go visit old friends again and have all the episodes and extras. There is a lot of value here, plenty to watch and re-watch, especially if you are a fan of BBC historical drama series. If you are a fan of \"Downton Abbey\" and don't know this series, you are in for a treat.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I remember hearing about this series when I was a kid. Probably during the original US run in the 70's. I think they reran it after that. I can remember watching part of one episode, but it didn't appeal to me. Well, maybe I was too young to appreciate it.\n\nFast forward to a few months ago. Now middle aged, I decided to give this series another try. At first, it seemed OK, but I wasn't sure if I'd want to spend the time getting through the whole series. Didn't seem quite as well done as more recent British TV. But, I watched a few more episodes and got more interested. Before I knew it, I was on the 5th and last series and realized I was almost done. I was sad to see the last episode end. The characters seemed almost like old friends by then.\n\nI think the first episode is set in 1903 and the last in 1930. Many characters come and go, but many appear in the whole run like Mr. Hudson, Mrs. Bridges, Rose and Richard Bellamy.\n\nThe British class system in all its \"glory\" is illustrated as the series rolls on. And how it starts to unravel a bit as time moves forward. I guess as an American, it is hard to believe how those lower on the food chain put up with this system, but I guess we had something similar at the time here, but maybe less rigid. I'm told that the British still retain a bit of the old system even today, while we seem to have been a little more successful at getting rid of our old system.\n\nBut, I think one positive point that is often overlooked about the old system is well illustrated. There was some sense of family ties of a sort between the upstairs family and the long time servants downstairs.\n\nThe series did try to bring to life the big events going on at the time the series is set. It also showed how the upstairs people and the servants saw these events in very similar ways in many cases. I was surprised at how the servants were so often in agreement with the upstairs people on politics. Maybe they all valued stability and tradition very much and so agreed on the politics as a result.\n\nSometimes the formality of the interactions between the upstairs folk and the servants was almost comical, but it was still kind of nice to see it at times. We seem to live in a world without much in the way of good manners anymore.\n\nI'm sure that much has been written on the details of the series already by other reviewers, so I don't think there is much I could add there. So, I'll just say that this is a great series to watch and well worth the time required to watch all the episodes.\n\nThere was a continuation series that aired recently which I did watch well before I got far along in the old series reviewed here.  They don't seem all that related to me now that I have seen all of both. The new series was not very popular and didn't last very long. Two short seasons maybe. I thought it was OK.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Somehow I never really got into this when it played on Masterpiece Theater back in the 70s. However, since I am such a fan of Downton Abbey, I thought I would give it a try. And I am so glad I did. It begins in 1903 when there were still horse drawn carriages and strict rules of decorum, and goes through WWI, the roaring twenties, and into the Great Depression. I found the families very enduring, both upstairs and downstairs, and their struggles very real. You will love the characters: Mrs. Bridges, Ruby, Mr. Hudson, Rose, Edward, Sara, Thomas, Fredrick, and Daisy, and last, but not least, the Bellamy family and their friends.\n\nIt does not necessarily have a happy ending, but it is a satisfying one. I will be sure to watch this series again and again. I think it gives a good insight into the history of the time as well as telling an enduring story. It shows the decline of the noble class in England, how it began and came about. That was a little sad to me because I think we lost something of elegance and grace along the way to progress, and I could not help feeling that I wished we had at least some of it back. All in all, this is a very good series. I wish there had been more of it. I would have liked to seen what happened to the characters during the Great Depression.\n\nThe newer, more modern, series is also good, but sadly it was not renewed so it really does not have an ending, happy or otherwise. I was really looking forward to see how England survived WWII. Perhaps they will rethink the decision to cancel it and bring it back. These, like then, are hard times we live in, and it always helps to see a good drama to make you feel better.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "A thread runs through every season of Upstairs Downstairs tying the characters, and stories together in five seasons of continuity. This is the best written,best acted television drama I have ever viewed.\n  Where the modern day drama of \"Downton Abbey\" has characters that are cold and stiff. The writers of Downton Abbey leave out the humanity and underlying connectedness and dependence they all share with one another.\n  The writers of \"Upstairs Downstairs\" leave in the details of the human relationships that the characters have, as they act out the scenes.\n  An innate understanding of the characters is displayed, by each actor playing their part. A full picture of each character is revealed in scenes that show the characters motive, thought process, and conflict. A real understanding of human nature, class structure, and culture was known by the writers of this Magnificent piece of television history.\n  When one watches these stories you can see the heart, the soul, the humanity of the characters in the story. The show is not written pandering to one class or the other class, such amateur writing you will not see in Upstairs Downstairs.\n  What you will see are the trials, the laughter, the heartache, and love that both; the servants below and the Lords above go through in their journey  through life together. When the series ends you come to an understanding that these people all of them shared a life, with all of its ups, and downs, that they loved and relied on one another, just like a family does.", "label": "good review"}

Somehow I never saw it when it was aired on PBS and the discs were a bit pricy for a 'hope it's good' purchase.\n\nFinally I found this 40th Anniversary set -- produced by Acorn -- at an irresistible price and took the plunge.\n\nMy wife and I sat down and watched episodes 1 through 3 and each of us had the same reaction. What was all the fuss about?  Upstairs Downstairs seemed to be a mediocre, low-budget, Brit sitcom and nothing more. We took a few days off and then decided to give it another go. And are we glad we did! For starting in episode 4 the entire feel of the series changed from a cheap sitcom to thoughtful human drama.\n\nOkay, the \"cheap\" feeling stayed for somewhat longer. Only as the years went by did the production values start to go a bit upscale.  Never near the level of something like Downton Abbey, mind you, but good enough to become invisible.\n\nThe production and mastering of the Acorn set is so-so at best, both as to image and sound quality and the interface. (Oh, the junk you have to sit through on each year's disc one before the program starts! Ugh!) And instead of defaulting to having no subtitles 4 out of the 5 sets defaulted to subtitles on. Grrr!\n\nBut the drama itself is the thing and all that technical stuff pales into insignificance once we got absorbed into the characters and the stories. This is human drama as real as life -- full of the complexities, ambiguities, triumphs, joys, disappointments and sorrows of real life and told with feeling and an underlying appreciation for what it means to be human.

{"words": "Let me first begin by saying that I remember watching Up/Down when it first aired 40 years ago, as a then vulnerable and impressionable young lass of 17. I enjoyed the show immensely, it was really rather a first offering of PBS, then known primarily as a fledgling \"artsy\" station, presenting this hitherto unknown British series through WGBH in Boston. From its first episode, Up/Down oozed quality in every way: superb acting, writing, direction, production, with the added bonus of Alistair Cooke's introduction, while seated in a leather armchair next to a roaring fire prior to each episode, to the accompaniment of the famous Masterpiece Theatre theme, Mouret's Rondo, which added to the understated elegance and anticipation of each episode.\n\n The characters of Up/Down were many faceted and always interesting, not merely presented as one-dimensional, i.e., rich versus poor. One could even sympathize with the clueless and wealthy Bellamy family on occasion, theirs was a cocoon of privilege and comfort, yet their breeding never eschewed vulgarity or crassness, but embraced kindness, concern and responsible humanity toward their Downstairs \"family\". Similarly, their Downstairs family, in turn, showed respect, warm feelings of pride of service and true concern for their \"upstairs\" family as well. The viewer was entwined in the lives of both \"families\", experiencing their joys, sorrows and frustrations. All within a 25 year framework encompassing the Victorian and Edwardian ages, culminating in the death of Edward VII, the sinking of the Titanic and loss of Lady Marjorie Bellamy, World War I and its aftermath, the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression, forever changing the world of the Bellamys first shown in 1904. Up/Down is, simply, a breathtakingly unforgettable series.\n\nThis 40th anniversary release is equal to the many superlatives written on these pages of reviews. I had VHS taped some of the original Up/Down episodes when they were re-shown on PBS in the 80's, which I still have. However, I wanted the DVD version, and decided to purchase this 40th anniversary set through Amazon.  Let me say that it is simply superb in every way.\n\nThe episodes have been remastered to splendid effect, they are all excellent in both video and audio quality. I do not understand how some of the reviewers could state that they are not! They are all exceptionally good.  There are 21 DVD's in this set, with an added 25 hours of extras, narrating the making of Up/Down,interviews with many of the characters who are still living, and they seem to enjoy reminiscing, sharing many little unknown facts about the particular episodes being presented. Priceless. There are also narratives and commentaries in the episodes by some of the actors, scene selection, and an enclosed brief written narrative by Jean Marsh, one of the co-creators who also portrayed Rose, the under-house parlor maid. The audio commentaries by the actors and writers on each episode are great fun, listening to Jean Marsh and Simon Williams' comments give one a marvelous insider perspective. This is the definitive collection, it just doesn't get much better than this. I urge all Up/Down devotees, new and old, to purchase it. Also, the price on Amazon is about the lowest I have seen anywhere. It is well worth the price for this timeless and iconic series, presented as grandly as the series itself.

{"words": "For those who like British drama, one cannot find much better than the series entitled \"Upstair Downstairs\".  It protrays a fictional family and their servants living through the peaceful times of the 1910's, through WWI, and on until the early 1930's.  It is a great story and wonderful acting and directing.  The characters are truely believable and \"alive\"!

But I so enjoyed this series on PBS years ago, that I took the plunge and pre-ordered this 40th anniversary collection.\n\nBuyer's remorse? No way! I'm in the midst of hours of enjoyment going through this set in order, watching the episodes, the commentaries, the interviews, the special \"Making Of ..\" programs, and the other included extras.\n\nI find the video quality of these DVDs to be at a minimum acceptable, and often excellent. But then, I don't expect that a TV series shot on a modest budget in the UK in the 1970's on videotape, can be transformed into a fantastically hi-def TV experience on modern DVDs. I never saw the old A&E DVDs, which I have heard were of disappointing quality, so I can't compare these DVDs to those.\n\nAt this point I'm about half-way through the fourth season, the World War I episodes. And looking forward, after I finish writing this review, to heading back to the living room to watch another episode this evening.\n\nJust because this subject came up in a prior review: I have had no problem turning on (and off) the subtitles (aka closed captioning) using the onscreen menu of my Blu-ray player.", "label": "good review"}

I especially love the period when the Bellamy family and the downstairs family are going through WWI; Mrs. Bridges & Ruby going to a War Cookery lecture and making \"Win the War Pie\" for the servant's meal; it is nearly inedible to all but Ruby & Mrs. Bridges. So many wonderful moments and the series comes to the right ending. The film has faded to a degree, but pretty much looks the way I remember it in the 70s when first shown here. I'm so glad to have it in my collection, for I will be watching it over and over. Thanks for the memories.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "A TV gem period series. This 27-year span epic won 9 Emmys, 2 BAFTAs, Golden Globe & a Peabody Award, 31 nominations. The aristocratic Bellamy's of 165 Eaton Place, London, live upstairs over the downstairs clockwork servant aid led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson). Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic back time-travel over 3 decades inside the Bellamy house. A crowning British achievement in the 70's and worth owning today.\n\nSir Richard Bellamy MP (David Langton) and Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) have heir Lt James (Simon Williams) and Miss Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett-`A Bit of a Do') who need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Mrs. Bridges (Angela Brddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy. The pilot (an alternate plot pilot available) introduces new servant Sarah (Pauline Collins), who adds saucy spice to the house on both ends of the stairs. Footman Alfred (George Innes) who quotes Bible, Perce (Brian Osborne) is lady's-man coachman during carriage years, Thomas (John Alderton) chauffeur in later auto episodes. The star studded cast is endless.\n\nThis new release provides 21 discs in 5 solid cases all in the anniversary storage sleeve. Quite an improvement from the earlier release. 68 episodes, each about 50 min. Add 25 bonus hrs and you have a value, not to mention the dynamic dramatic entertainment including romance, mystery, drama, historical significance, humor, suspense, & more. Episodes 2,3,4,5,&7 are B/W due to a technicians strike. Pilot was remade in color. The features + bonus time total divided by the current Amazon price makes the HOURLY entertainment cost less than $1.87. A VALUE!\n\nSUBTITLES-THIS SET OFFERS SUBTITLES. Helpful for some of us.  A Jean Marsh memories insert is included and created in Oct. 2010.\n\nSERIES 1: 1903-09, introduces cast, Bellamy house trials, scandal, love, and the delight of seeing the wonderfully differences between the working and upper classes. Great plots in every episode, too many to list. Always sub-plots, upstairs and downstairs. Delightful set and an array of costuming that shows both the upper and lower class dress of the times.\nSERIES 2: 1908-10, shows life with a newly married Bellamy, potential fatherhood, and romance downstairs too. All scandalous in high society, as is several topics this show dared to address in the 70s. Cast members playing Sarah and Thomas would eventually marry in real-life.\nSERIES 3: 1912-14, the period finds Kind Edward VII is dead and pending war. World war and politics are just a fraction of the turmoil found at house 165. Love upstairs and downstairs is as treacherous as the war trenches. Reason enough for this seasons' best drama series Emmy & Golden globe.\nSERIES 4: 1914-18, the Great War is happening, and it touches the Bellamy house stairway ends. Another 2 Emmys won due to struggles with soldiering, war efforts, changes in lifestyle due to war, and love at all times. A fine dramatic, but historical look at WWI, on the London home front.\nSERIES 5: 1919-30, the largest span of time. War's end. The 1920's roar, and that impacts the family upstairs as well as the lively help downstairs. But even war fails to change some things, like scandal, family disgrace, celebrations, and again the outstanding drama series Emmy and the prestigious Peabody Award.\n\nAfter the airing of \"The Forsyte Saga\" (a must series also), Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the \"Upstairs Downstairs\" concept. Jean stared as Rose in the 70s TV blockbuster, and now continues that role in the continuation of the story on Brit TV (Dec '10). 3 episodes advance the story now to 1936, with a new cast (excepting Marsh) and also now including Atkins as Maud, the same house, same music, same title. After \"Upstairs Downstairs\" the pair of actresses combined again in creating \"The House of Eliott\", another period saga, bloody good Brit drama, an absolute must own \"complete collection.\"\nThere you have my lengthy opinion, but so much in this anniversary edition.

{"words": "One of the most successful British television dramas, \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" became one of the few english programs to attain global recognition, garnering an impressive seven american Emmy awards when it originally aired between 1971-1975. Most Americans saw the series when it ran on local PBS stations and later cable's A&E channel, while Canadians viewed it via the CBC.\n\n The series dealt with the rich and the poor and as any lover of soap opera knows when you pit these two types of people together fireworks will ignite. Indeed a soap, \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" dealt with the rich Bellamy family living in the high class Belgravia neighborhood in London. Their lives were intertwined by their servants who lived \"downstairs\" and who wanted to attain the richness and social standing of their employers. World War 1 was the backdrop for the serial which only added extra drama to the show.\n\n \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" is known as the series where many Hollywood leading ladies received their start, most notably Jean Marsh (who had a hand in the creation of the show) and Lesley-Ann Down, most famous for her role in \"North and South\" and currently starring in \"The Bold and the Beautiful\".\n\n This beautiful box set contains 21 DVD's featuring all the show's 68 episodes and has a plethora of extras that include over 25 hours of never-before-seen footage! The bonus features include a 5 part documentary called \"The Making of \"Upstairs, Downstairs\", 24 episode commentaries, interviews with cast members, and more. Sadly, when the producers went into the ITV archives to clean the show's original prints it was discovered the pilot had been \"wiped\" which was the custom for many British shows in the early seventies.\n\n The first two seasons of \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" (known as \"series\" in Britain) will be available individually with the release of the entire series box set. The remaining three seasons will be on store shelves before the end of 2011.\n\n The series has been revived on the BBC as of late 2010.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I bought this for my wife for Christmas and we began watching it shortly thereafter. Initially I was discouraged with it because the first episodes are terrible. But my wife persisted and after six to eight episodes it began to get considerably better. Within ten episodes we were enjoying it a great deal. I think it was because the first episodes were lacking in pathos and charm, the writers trying to keep things a bit dark like an American soap opera. But when they gave that up it took on a life and personality of its own. The first segments (which were filmed in black and white) also had a stagey quality almost like burlesque where the actors overact to convey their emotions over great distances (unnecessary on the small screen obviously). I also had trouble with the son, whom I don't think is quite as strong an actor as the others (such as the actor who plays the butler Hudson, who is excellent) but he gets better as the series progresses.\n\nOther actors come and go making a slow but steady evolution toward a very enjoyable ensemble series.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Upstairs Downstairs is the example par excellence of British television.  Over five seasons during the 1970s, Upstairs Downstairs riveted audiences in Britain, while in America, it more than any other series made Masterpiece Theater an essential part of Sunday evening television.\n\nUpstairs Downstairs is the story of the Bellamy family of 165 Eaton Place, London from about 1903 to 1930.  The Bellamys are an aristocratic family with a houseful of servants.  The interplay of story line and personality between Upstairs (the Bellamys and their friends and relatives) and Downstairs (the assorted servants) was beautifully done.  Some of the episodes tended to be a bit too soap operaish, but at its best the series was utterly spellbinding and memorable.\n\nThis megaset contains every episode of the original five seasons.  Some of the transfers are not all that clear, and a few of the openings have been truncated or even omitted entirely.  The megaset also contains a spin off of the series, Thomas and Sarah, based on the lives of two of the servants after they left 165.  Thomas and Sarah has nowhere near the quality of the original series and does not, in my opinion, deserve to be grouped with it.  But nevertheless this megaset is the best way to obtain and enjoy Upstairs Downstairs today.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "The first episode was in color.  The next episodes were in black and white.  The sound went up and down throughout each episode.  I think it was episode 21 or 22 which was repeated and the ensuing episode wasn't on the disc.  I wrote the BBC to ask about getting a replacement disc with the missing episode and never got a response.\n\nWhoever did the quality control for this DVD set should be required to give us all refunds or at the very least prevented from ever producing DVDs again.\n\nI bought this series as a gift and it made it look like I bought some slightly irregular box set on clearance, instead of getting a quality set like I assumed I was gifting, which was highly embarassing.  So if you're buying it for someone else, keep it in mind that they're going to be disappointed.\n\nYou'll still get to see most of the episodes, but expect that you'll be adjusting the volume throughout your viewing and don't count on watching the episodes in color, as they originally aired.  At least it's a period piece, so you can tell yourself that's why it's in black and white.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "What a pleasure to be able to watch every episode of \"Upstairs Downstairs\" at your own pace, with NO commercials or fundraising breaks!\n\nI was surprised watching this megaset how many episodes I don't recall ever seeing.  I'm not sure whether that's because I was out of the house at the time -- in the days before VCRs -- or because some of the episodes have elements reflecting the racism, anti-semitism, or other unfortunate aspects of the Edwardian age which U.S. networks elected not to broadcast.\n\nAt any rate, one need look no further than the brilliant first episode to see why this series is one of the best -- if not the single best -- historical drama ever, and every bit as captivating today as when it was originally broadcast.\n\nWith clockwork precision, the first episode introduces us to the aristocratic Bellamy family who live upstairs at 165 Eaton Place, and their staff of devoted servants working downstairs.  We see how the house functions, in particular the duties of the servants through the course of the day -- and we are introduced to one of the richest casts of characters this side of Dickens.\n\nThe steadfast and resourceful Hudson the butler, played by the late, great Gordon Jackson... the fastidious Mrs. Bridges the cook, played by Angela Baddeley... Rose the parlor maid, played by series co-creator Jean Marsh... Mr. and Lady Bellamy, played by David Langton and Rachel Gurney... their children James and Elizabeth, played by Simon Callow and Nicola Paget... all are indelible creations magnificently realized.\n\nIn the course of the series, the years from the first quarter of the twentieth century come to life with an unerring eye for detail, from the advent of electricity in the home to the adoption of the automobile to the crackle of the first crystal radios and early victrolas to the sinking of the Titanic to the horrors of World War I and the crash of the stock market in 1929.\n\nWatching the series again, I was moved to tears on a number of occasions.  I felt as if I was spending time with a dear family I hadn't seen in many years.\n\nThis megaset also includes a twenty-fifth anniversary special that reunited many of the cast members to reminisce about the production.  One of the most amusing anecdotes comes from series co-creator Marsh, who recalls that there were \"upstairs\" dressing rooms for the cast and \"downstairs\".  The former had windows and boxes of tissue; the latter did not.  The Bellamy family cast were automatically assigned the \"upstairs\" dressing rooms -- until Marsh finally spoke up and noted that as series co-creator, she deserved a box of tissues as much as Rachel Gurney!\n\nThen there is the spinoff series, \"Thomas and Sarah\", featuring the ever-scheming, never-succeeding former chauffeur and maid of the Bellamy household, which I consider more of a curiosity than a drama as compelling as \"Up Down\" itself.  Still it is a welcome inclusion for dedicated fans.\n\nI have deducted one star for the technical problems of this DVD set, which have been cited by other reviewers as well.  A&E obviously didn't lavish the same attention to detail on the mastering of these discs as the writers, directors, and actors who created the show, and it's a shame.  Especially annoying are the little boxes of \"digital dither\" that appear in the upper right corners of many episodes, plus the nonexistent color correction in others.\n\nStill, these technical issues detract only slightly from the breathtaking panoply of the drama unfolding here, and at a price around half that of the box set when it was first introduced, this megaset still merits inclusion in a British television enthusiast's collection.\n\nOne hopes, as others have noted, that A&E will eventually release an improved megaset that clears up these technical issues and perhaps includes another set of reminiscences from the series creators and television commentators.\n\nUntil then -- \"look sharp,\" as Hudson would say, and order this spectacular set to enjoy with your family!", "label": "good review"}

The sound quality was fine so perhaps I got one of the good sets; I don't know.\n\nThe series itself is delightful and I'm so glad that I purchased it so that I can watch it again and again.  I would brew a pot of tea, pour it into my finest china tea cup, enjoy some scones or crumpets and take myself back in time.  I became so fond of the Bellamy family and even more so of the downstairs family that when I came to the end of the series, I was sad but then, I can visit w/them any time I like, can't I?  There are many reviews here that tell of each character in the series, so I won't bore you w/all that, just will mention that each family \"knew their place\" in the class system at that period of time and there was snobbery at both levels.  I have my favorite characters, Mr. Hudson and Ruby, to name two of them and I found myself getting really caught up in their drama, especially w/the way that the cook, Mrs. Bridges, treated poor, slow, lovable Ruby.  At times I would forget that it was only a story.  So does that tell you how good the acting is?\n\nI thought that I wouldn't like the follow up series \"Thomas and Sarah\" but I enjoyed it immensely as well.  I was, however, dismayed by the ending and while I won't include a spoiler, I will say that it, too, left me sad and wanting more.\n\nDon't hesitate to purchase this series.

I purchased the complete series along with the season of Thomas & Sarah.\n This is an extraordinary compilation of the Edwardian period of English history.  The escapades of over 27 years of English history is indeed grand.  Upstairs resides the family Bellamy with all their aristocratic problems.  Below, downstairs resides the people of service led by the steadfast Angus Hudson who resided as the Butler.  The complete series covers the intrigues from 1903 to 1930.

{"words": "It goes without saying that \"Upstairs/Downstairs\" is a brilliant, entertaining series well worth the owning.  When Amazon offered the Collector's Edition Megaset on a great sale, I couldn't pass it up.  I didn't really remember the series well, but I knew I very much wanted to see it.  Like others, I read the discouraging reviews about the A&E Home Video transfer, but I thought, I'm not really that picky and it's probably not all that bad.  Well, I am not that picky; I don't care about things being in HD or looking like a \"Harry Potter\" movie.  That said, I want readers to know, I was very, very disappointed in the visual and sound quality of A&Es Megaset.  So much so, I had given thought to sending this set back and exchanging it for another in hopes that it might be better.  But first I did some research.  I googled \"Why are the DVDs of A&E's Upstairs/Downstairs so bad?\" and found an informative website which had a page on the US A&E version.  It made it clear that A&E Home Video had used old copies of the episodes for their remastering instead of getting new ones from the UK, undoubted a cost saving measure on their part.  As someone who has purchased many of these wonderful, older British series, I can tell you that the A&E version of the Joan Hickson \"Miss Marple\"s are not terribly good either, although they are certainly better than these sorry things. I have only taken a quick look at the two Thomas & Sarah DVDs and they do appear to be somewhat better than Upstairs/Downstairs.

{"words": "I wish I could give it a hundred stars, this Upstairs, Downstairs is absolute magic. A story about the Bellamy family and their servants, it goes beyond any kind of play or soap (quite frankly, I think it merged qualities of both quite successfully)--but it draws you INTO the family and you feel like you actually become a PART of the whole thing. Troubles? Sure always troubles with both the wealthy family and troubles with the servants. But even in real life, it always has trouble, doesn't it. Frequently very touching; sometimes even shocking; it's GREAT! I LOVE THESE DVDs! I don't give a flip what other people say about the alleged picture and sound quality \"troubles\".  I say, honestly, just WHERE are these alleged \"toubles\"--remember it was made for television; in fact during some of the early season you have some black and white episodes due to some kind of technical crew strike or whatever.

{"words": "I now see why many people adore \"Upstairs Downstairs,\" and also why it has its place among classic television. The whole show is actually a time capsule during the time of pre-WWI UK and after (up to the US stock market crash in 1929.) It is very interesting to note the various stages of changes that were happening during that time. It's like a history lesson but with more fun in it (apologies to my History teacher.) In this, the makers of this wonderful miniseries did not fail in their mission to make things as authentic as possible. Personally, I cannot boast about knowing much about English soceity during the Edwardian era, for my knowledge of it actually comes from period movies and television programs that I had seen before. But when I said \"authentic,\" what I meant was that we can see and feel the labour of love that was put into every detail to make the show feel at home in its period setting.\n\nIn addition, this is no ordinary soap opera because it really has a lot of things to say about many issues. One might think that the people who inhabit the stories are shallow and uninteresting. After all, what can be interesting about the lives of parlourmaids, footmen, or drawing room ladies? But then, in \"Upstairs Downstairs,\" you will find otherwise because the writers somehow managed to give the stories and the characters flesh and blood, as well as humor and tears. Though dignified as the \"Upstairs\" masters may be, the writers prove that these people are not infallible, and that they are as susceptible to mistakes as any other class of human being. As for the \"Downstairs\" servants, though they toil all day long, we see that they do have lives of their own that are also interesting.\n\nHaving said the above, I guarantee that you will root for most of the characters. I love Lady Marjorie the best; captivating Georgina, no-nonsense Hazel, and Virginia as the second Mrs. Bellamy I love second. They are such adorable and charming people. I shall never forget that scene where Lady Marjorie tells Hudson the butler that \"the King will be dining with us next week.\" She was picture-perfect in that one. As for the men, I always admire Mr. Bellamy for his political convictions. Although we don't actually get to see the hearings in the House of Commons, we do get a firsthand look of what goes on behind the life of a parliament member. It is this aspect of the show that gives \"Upstairs Downstairs\" its political dimension. As for Elizabeth and James, I disliked them most of the time because they are spoiled, but they do have their human moments. Plus, Nicola Pagett and Simon Williams are such good, good actors. These two have some of the best parts in the whole series; Simon Williams, especially, as James, during the War years and after that.\n\nGoing now to the servants, there's Edward and his pretty wife Daisy. There's also Rose, who really lost a chance at the one happiness that she could have get (find it out for yourself.) Mr. Hudson, I sometimes find disappointing because of his prejudiced views. But during the times when he is in his right principles, you will admire him for it. Mrs. Bridges might be scoldy, but she really is a mother at heart, having no children of her own. It may surprise you to find out that she never had a husband. Ruby the scullery maid might be trivial, but she does have the spotlight in \"The Hero's Farewell,\" one of my favorite episodes. She also has a funny line at the final episode where she was contemplating that it won't be long before she gets the guesthouse all to herself. As for Thomas and the scene stealing Sarah, you will either like them or dislike them, but they do have their place in the story.\n\nThe last episode is a touching one, since we would have gotten used to the characters and feel that we know them already. I was sorry to see the members of the Bellamy household disbanded like that. I especially felt heart-pangs when Rose (Jean Marsh) was closing down the empty house. The ghosts of the past whispered into her ears as she did this, from floor to floor of 165 Eaton Place. These final few minutes of the show will not soon go away from your memory,.\n\nAs companions to this series, I would like to recommend the \"Berkeley Square\" Series and Stephen Poliakoff's \"The Lost Prince.\" Both of these can be had here at Amazon. There is no doubt that \"Berkeley Square\" had its roots in \"Upstairs Downstairs.\" To see \"Berkeley Square\" is to extend the enjoyment after viewing \"Upstairs Downstairs.\" But to get a better understanding of the political situation of the time period, I would recommend Stephen Poliakoff's \"The Lost Prince.\" This is considered to be one of Mr. Poliakoff's best works. I guarantee that \"Berkeley Square\" and \"The Lost Prince\" will not disappoint. Both are BBC productions.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the show, definitely a keeper. Some of the episodes might not be appropriate for younger viewers, as they touch on subjects about homosexuality, a murder, and suicides. The episode \"Alberto\" might also not be suitable for younger audiences, because it has an element worthy of an \"R\" rating. Other than that, it's mostly safe. The best part of the show was during the years of the War, when everybody had to make sacrifices, and when nothing was really certain. One lesson that the show teaches many a time is that WORDS CAN HURT. Parents will do wise to instill this into the minds of youngsters.\n\nA word about picture quality: since this is a show over thirty years of age, one mustn't give it a lot of expectations. I think there's a limit of what our current technology can do in the field of DVD transfer. I personally don't mind the sometimes grainy quality (plus the black and white of the first few episodes) because it gives it more vintage. What I do complain grievely about is the lack of subtitles; and, there's not much of a bonus feature.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "It is no exaggeration to say that this classic early 70's British period drama is one of the all-time best series of its sort ever produced.  With sixty-eight 50-minute episodes, the series covers a time span of nearly 30 years (from early Edwardian England in 1903, through the horrors of the First World War, and on into the Roaring 20s, finally concluding with 1929's stock market crash). The setting is the household of the Bellamy family at 165 Eaton Place, London.  Upstairs live Richard Bellamy, MP, and his beautiful, aristocratic wife, Lady Margery. The Bellamys have two adult children, Captain James and Elizabeth, who come and go much like a recurring motif (though recurring nightmare might be more appropriate, for they are the source of much grief (albeit unintended) for their society parents). I don't wish to give the storylines, scandals and surprises away. Suffice it to say that as the series progress, there are lovers, marriages, births and deaths (not to mention the arrival of a beautiful young niece) which impact on the relationships and alter the composition of the group above stairs.\n\nDownstairs we are privy to the lives of the servants in the Bellamy household. First and foremost is the devout, inflexible and regimental head butler, Angus Hudson, the staff overlord. Then there is the curmudgeonly but good-hearted cook, Mrs. Bridges. Other memorable characters include the efficient but sheltered head house/parlour maid, Rose Buck; the religious but simple footman, Alfred; his successor, the good-natured Edward, who has an eye for the female staff; the not-overly-bright scullery maid, Emily, and her successor and intellectual equal, Ruby; and Lady Margery's prim and snobbish lady's maid, Miss Roberts.  Of course, one simply cannot forget the sassy, vivacious new under house/parlour maid, Sarah (Pauline Collins), who is a real dreamer and schemer and who, like a bad penny, turns up on the Bellamys' doorstep periodically during the first two series, or the new capable-but-just-as-conniving chauffeur, Thomas (Collins' real-life husband, John Alderton), who is nobody's fool!  Like the family upstairs, the downstairs \"family\" too has its share of comings and goings, what with lovers, marriages, deaths, hirings, and firings.\n\nThis boxed set includes the 1979 spin-off series entitled Thomas and Sarah (thirteen 50-minute episodes), which chronicles the adventures and misadventures of those two memorable miscreants after they leave the Bellamy's employ.  Unlike Upstairs Downstairs, which is fairly high drama infused with a spattering comic relief here and there, Thomas and Sarah is very much a comedy-drama.  With Sarah's penchant for foreign accents and tale-telling and the conniving and entrepreneurial spirit that both characters embody, the stage is set for some thoroughly enjoyable vignettes. Most of the episodes involve the couple trying their hands (and luck) at something new--like running a match-making agency, working in a boys' school, working as magicians, and so on.  For all their efforts, however, they always seem to find themselves skint--and thus the need for another enterprise (and hence another enjoyable episode!).  The only thing less than satisfactory is the \"conclusion\" of the final episode, which left me wondering whether or not a second series was at least anticipated.  But that's is a minor quibble, for this is a series to be watched for the sheer enjoyment of the journey.\n\nOne final dvd bonus is the enjoyable and informative 50-minute 25th Anniversary Special,  which was produced around 1998 and includes remembrances by many of the surviving actors (including James, Elizabeth, Rose, Edward, Daisy, and Ruby).\n\nIn conclusion, Upstairs Downstairs is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series.  It is compelling, captivating, and often thought-provoking; and if you enjoy a dramatic series with lots of \"goings on,\" scandal, and so forth, you'll enjoy it all the more!  The inclusion of Thomas and Sarah is a delightful, light-hearted, entertaining bonus, and I highly, HIGHLY recommend this boxed set to all fans of the very best in British period drama.", "label": "good review"}

There is little change in the household throughout these two series, and although the entire series is spectacular, these first two sets are my favourite. Series three covers the period from 1912 to the start of WWI. Series four covers the war (1914-1918), and its depiction of the realities of war from the human standpoint is unsurpassed, making series four a very, very strong series indeed. Series five covers the twenties.\n\nIn conclusion, this is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series. I would, in fact, go so far as to say that it is required viewing for anyone who enjoys first-rate period drama. But its appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys compelling, captivating, and often thought-provoking drama; and if you enjoy a dramatic series with lots of \"goings on,\" scandal, and so forth, you'll enjoy it all the more! It's a large set, but it's well worth taking a chance on.  I simply cannot imagine anyone not enjoying it.

{"words": "I rejoice in the technological development of DVDs which provides the perfect format for the celebrated release, in one complete box set, of one of the finest series that has ever graced, or will ever grace, TV!\n\nThis British series is truly in a \"class\" by itself. It's characters are unforgettable, the acting inspired and the backdrop evocative - Edwardian England from 1904 into the 1930s.\n\nThe story evolves around the aristocractic Bellamy family \"Upstairs\" at 165 Eaton Place, London, and their servants \"Downstairs,\" but it is not a soap opera. It is as genuine, real and honest as any period production, or for that matter, any production, that I have ever seen.\n\nThe characters grapple with the same struggles that we continue to confront in mordern-day America: love, loss, coming of age, morality, prejudice, death, economics, social responsibility, unwed mothers, change, freedom and the search for life's ultimate meaning - concluding with the horrendous effects of a World War and its devastating aftermath.\n\nThe \"master\" of the house, Sir Richard Bellamy, played with genuine heart by David Langton, is in Parliament thanks to the enormous political influence of the family of his well-bred wife, Lady Marjorie Southwold Bellamy, played with aplumb and surprising depth by Rachel Gurney.\n\nWe come to know the couple and their problems, as we witness a doomed love affair by Marjorie with an artist that she forsakes to save her mariage and which underscores the power of duty in English society. Richard learns of the affair but doesn't address it directly with his wife, whom he resolutely adores, but instead stands by her as she grieves for the one true love she has chosen to give up. Marjorie's life is cut short (the actress left the show after two seasons) after a fateful voyage on the Titanic.\n\nThe Bellamy's house parlormaid Rose Buck is portrayed by Jean Marsh, who created the show and starred throughout the series. Rose is compassionate, tough and as real a \"person\" as if she had actually been alive.\n\nOther tremendous characters of this brilliant ensamble cast include the butler, Angus Hudson, portrayed by the late, great Gordon Jackson, the Bellamy's cook, Mrs. Kate Bridges, played by the late Angela Baddeley, and the Bellamy's son, James Bellamy, played by the gifted Simon Williams.\n\nIt is Hudson who not only keeps the house running smoothly, but is also the keeper of English social propriety and tradition, objecting to modernization and the merging of social classes. Hudson desperately tries to hold onto the society he knew and loved, but international events conspire to change the very fibre of British culture.\n\nBut, it is through the character of James Bellamy that these historical events are played out. Initially, a \"useless\" member of the young nobility, James was restless and lived primarily for himself and leisure pursuits. Uncontrollably, he is swept up in the tide that became World War I and changed England, as well as the World, forever.\n\nJames becomes an officer and sees combat and the horrors of war. James eventually returns to Eaton Place after the war ends, but is unable to cope with his \"new\" life or reclaim his \"old\" one, so he ends it by his own hand in the former safety of the family estate.\n\nAs the series ends, the Edwardian age of English innocence and \"fun\" has also truly suffered a fatally self-inflicted wound. So, it is fitting that after James' suicide it is the nostalgic Hudson who, with a tear in his eye, closes the house -- and thereby symbolically, the era -- forever.\n\nThese are only a few of the characters and events that become real in the series, which ran through 68 riviting episodes.\n\nThis unflinching look at history as well as a truly timeless, engaging family saga is not to be missed. The series was originally broadcast on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre, and was introduced each week by the late popular historian, Allistair Cooke.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I remember looking forward to Sunday nights in the 1970's, when Upstairs, Downstairs was Masterpiece Theater's offering, introduced by the divine Alistair Cooke.  When this DVD set arrived, I hoped that at least it could recreate the Edwardian world for me, as it did 30+ years ago.  I was wrong.  It is so much better than I remember.  With the perspective and experience of thirty years coloring the viewing, the foibles and triumphs of the two families upstairs and down are so much more compelling now.  With the underlying theme that the house must run smoothly no matter what is going on in the inside or outside world, the dependence of the two families on each other is beautifully portrayed.  The period details, down to the china patterns and the paint colors are exquisite, and the characterizations the actors bring to their parts, made possible by the very fine writing, superb.\n\n  From the first episode when Lady Marjorie hires Sarah \"On Trial\" and gently but firmly establishes Sarah's position in the household, through the elegance and grandeur of the Edwardian era, \"There's no one to touch you, Mrs. Bridges, when it comes to lamb,\" the exigencies of WWI, when poor shell-shocked Edward the footman is cared for by Lord Bellamy; to the bittersweet end, when Lord Bellamy's diatribe when James loses Rose's inheritance in the stock market crash of 1929, causes a tragedy; the delicate balance between upstairs and down is fascinating and amazing to watch.  The pride the servants take in the successes of the upstairs family, which their support makes possible, and the avuncular care with which the Bellamys \"look after\" the servants (\"I hate to see servants humiliated,\" says Georgina, when unexpectedly confronted with Frederick in an embarassing situation) make this series particularly fascinating to Americans, for whom this way of life has never existed.\n\n  Despite bombs falling, housemaids giving birth in the attic, party guests committing suicide outside the nursery, various forms of heartbreak occuring both upstairs and down, it's reassuring to know that at 165 Eaton Place, dinner will always be served by an impeccably clad butler on impeccably polished silver, and that tea in the servant's hall will always be accompanied by one of Mrs. Bridges' delicious cakes (when she's not in a snit about being made to go to a lecture on wartime cookery).\n\n  No, the quality of the DVDs is not the best, but given a choice between owning it, with all its glitches and jumps--and not having it available at all--I'll take it. There are no problems distracting enough to make it unwatchable. This remarkable series has stood the test of time and truly shines.  The fine writing, splendid acting and authentic sets involve the viewer in the stories to the extent that the minor jumps and glitches are unimportant.  My only complaint is that Alistair Cooke's wonderful introductions are not included.", "label": "good review"}

The quality of the color footage varies at times but it certainly gives you the feeling that you were there much more than if you were to watch the same footage shot only in black and white.  The quality of the sound is excellent. Thank goodness for the History Channel from which this program comes!\n\nThe first of the two DVDs contains color films of events beginning at about the time of The Spanish Civil War and the coronation of a new King (George) in Great Britain. We witness footage of English statesmen actually visiting amicably with Hitler; Hitler sure had them fooled! There is interesting footage of great historical value concerning the German invasions of countries like Poland and The Soviet Union; and we also see the horrifying color footage of the fires in London during the German bombing of the city.\n\nThe first DVD also includes footage of the fight in the Pacific; we see our men fighting to capture islands in the Pacific that could be sued as bases for important military maneuvers including the Enola Gay flight that would drop \"the bomb\" on Japan.\n\nIn addition, there is color footage of the brutal Wausau ghetto where Jews were housed like cattle and children were left as orphans on the streets to die. The brutal treatment of the Jews and other Nazi atrocities are made very clear throughout the course of this two DVD set.\n\nThe second DVD gives us footage of the last year and one-half of the war. We see D Day, the rescue of France, other countries, and the people in concentration camps from brutal German occupation and the gradual erosion of Hitler's German military machine. The footage continues to show us a great deal of bombing, damage from bombing and carnage. It's truly fascinating to watch World War II in color.\n\nThe DVDs have some extras on the second of the two DVDs. What we get is mostly more color footage that was not used for the actual program of World War II in color. There is footage of Hitler and the elite guards at his country estate and we get great footage of Americans fighting their best. We see more footage of fires raging through destroyed cities--and more.

I also expected this DVD set to be better than \"World War II in Color, the British Story.\"  On the contrary, the latter costs less than half of this one, ran over an hour longer and had more unique footage and commentary.  The \"British Story\" is all on a single, collector's edition, digital disc.\n\nFor those building a DVD library on World War II, especially color features, this 2-volume set belongs in your collection.

{"words": "Apart from the obvious important issue of color, \"Lost Color Archives\" is different from many other documentaries dealing with World War II.  The emphasis is much less on causes and facts than it is on the impact of the war on society and individuals.  Its use of personal observances is remeniscent of the way Ken Burns used eye witness accounts in \"The Civil War\" to make more of an impact on the viewer.\nEvenso, from a historical perspective, \"Lost Color Archives\" does deserve high praise as a solid explanation of the war as a whole.  Because it is told largely from the eye witness point of view, the viewer has a sense of the impending conflict, then the endurance through the war, and finally, the exhausted conclusion.  Emphasis is placed on the fact that the war was over, but that much of the world had been destroyed and that the effects and rememberance of the war would linger on.\nAdd color to all this and the documentary clearly stands above anything else I've ever seen about the war.

{"words": "For persons who are interested in looking into the ways in which ancient Rome went to war, this is a must-buy video.  It is one of the more well-done documentaries that I have seen and does an excellent job of laying out the battle tactics, territory, major personages and instruments of Roman warfare up until about the time of the Antonine rulers.\nWhat makes this documentary particularly special is its usage of authentic and re-created signs of Roman hegemony.  For example, we have the opportunity to view a  nearly full-scale mock up of a Roman fort in a forest located in Germany.  We also see the palisades where Vercingetorix made his last stand in what is modern day France.\nOn top of this, we are invited to archeological excavations in & around Hadrian's Wall which was built to demark the line between Great Britain and Scotland (Caledonia).  The scholars there disinter the coinage of Rome thru the ages, as well as ancient letters of soldiers, medical instruments and much more.  Fascinating stuff!\nFor a grand overview of the expanse of the Roman empire, this would be a terrific video-set to buy.  However, precious little is shown or alluded to Rome itself.  For those who are only interested in the history & politics inside Rome, other documentaries would be much more appropriate.  If, on the other hand, you want to know more about the Legions on the frontiers of Roman territories, the present videos would be a superb choice.", "label": "good review"}

Once we removed the switch (the weakest link), we had no issues.\n\nIf you need something reliable for a peformance I would recommend something like the Proco Power Mute.  Sure it's more expensive, but it's built like a tank, the performer can stomp on the footswitch and the light turns green (mic on) or red (mic off), and it's transparent as far as effecting your sound.

{"words": "I purchased two of these Y adapters about eight years ago. They lasted about six years with very occasional use before both developed shorts in the cheap XLR connectors. It's really a problem with all Hosa XLR products in that the XLR connectors they use on everything are really cheap and have a poor design flaw where the cable moves too freely in the rubber boot without any real crimping of the cable by the plug. As a result, the wire will eventually break strand by strand at the pins of the connector as the cable works its way back and forth from use. Higher quality and higher price XLR connectors like the industry standard Neutrik XLR plugs have a different design and don't allow this to happen. Then again, you won't find a Neutrik Y adapter for the low price of these Hosa ones. They are cheap and they work for awhile but for as cheap as they are you can just buy new ones when the old ones develop a short which is exactly what I did.", "label": "bad review"}

I also like that it doesn't have that steam vent hole because I hate those things. Your cooking progress is partially track-able because as the time lapses the light for the lower time frame lights up. So if you start at 8 hours the 8 hour light is on, then when there is under 6 hours left the 6 hour light comes on, and so on. But unless you remember exactly what time you started you don't know exactly where you are within the 2 hour increment. It's not that much of a huge deal but a countdown timer that lets you set exactly the hours and minutes you want (instead of committing to 2 hour increments) and shows exactly how much time is left would be even better. That plus one of those latching lids that Hamilton Beach has on some other models of slow cookers would make it pretty much perfect, if more expensive. The price is so low there's room for the cost of improved features as an upgraded model.\n\nThe Cuisinart still looks nice, but I really like being able to add the extra vegetables and meat and still have that comfortable 1/2 inch of space from the top of the food to the top of the crock for cooking space, so I'm still glad to have this one instead.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "It's a good pot: heavy enough, heats evenly, and made in the U.S.A., which is a nice plus. One mark against it is the lid has a seal between the steel and glass components that allows water to get in. I happened to discover this when some water dripped from this space into some hot oil. It was a bit of a nuisance. On the whole I liked it enough to later pick up the 12\" saute pan too.", "label": "good review"}

They didn't have any left in stock, so I decided to purchase a 50\" plasma from a local dealer.  None of the locals had the Panasonic that I wanted, so I went with the Samsung HP-R5072.  I had the Samsung for 20 days before I returned it and purchased the Panasonic TH50PX500.\n\nAll-in-all, the picture on the Samsung had a good picture, but it did not have near the picture clarity and color vibrance that the Panasonic has.  Additionally, this Samsung model has and \"electronic program guide\" - not to be confused withe the \"TV GUIDE\" version.  Needless to say, the Samsung version did not work and requires each channel to transit their program information and that just does not happen.  The Panasonic TH50PX500 does have the \"TV Guide\" version and it worked great.  Finally, the split screen cabability and integration capability with other Panasonic products put the Panasonic over the top when compared to the Samsung.  One last thing, the Samsung remote is very minimal as far as capability goes.  Panasonic has this beat hands down.\n\nThe opinions found here are totally mine and were not influenced in any manner resulting from the discounted or free product.

At that time, I bought a large number of them (several dozens) because I was afraid that they would stop making them since Moleskine was still a small company.  Recently, my supply ended and I bought a few more.  I was disappointed because the quality of the paper was not the same as the original.  I tried a couple of alternatives and did not like them (I hated Rhodia paper because it's too glossy and I thought that Leuchtturm's index pages were annoying).  I concluded that the best option was to use Moleskine sketchbooks because their thicker paper is nice.  However, they are pricey. Last week, I decided to try the Essentials Notebook.  I am very impressed.  The paper is better than the current regular Moleskine notebook and more similar to the original.  The binding, cover, etc., are very similar to the Moleskine.  And their price is significantly lower.  I still think that the Moleskine sketchbook is a better option in terms of paper quality but it has its disadvantages besides the price (fewer pages and it might be too much for someone who only uses it for notes).

I loved it so much that I decided to get myself the new 2015 one.\n\nScott Hilburn sees the world through different eyes and for this I am thankful!  Every day I get a good laugh!  The drawings are awesome, the wit is off-the-wall, and one can certainly relate to each and every cartoon.  Some of them remind me of certain friends and family members, so I make sure to pass that specific day along to that special person.\n\nI can't tell you how much fun this calendar is.  As a bonus, on the back of each day there is THE DAILY EXTRA which cites quotes, words of wisdom, puzzles, household tips, etc.  So, actually, you are getting two treats each day.\n\nTHE 2015 ARGYLE SWEATER calendar sits right here on my computer desk so I can enjoy it daily.  Do yourself a favor and get one for that special person or for yourself!  You won't be sorry and the laughs never stop.\n\nThanks Scott Hilburn for your wacky view of our world and for your considerable talents!", "label": "good review"}

Instead the layout is lazy with all four, tiny panels stretched across the top third of each page, te middle third blank and the bottom third displaying the same picture of Linus and Snoopy every day.\nPoor.\nDifficult to read but, if you have your reading glasses on, the strips are classic and worth a look every day.", "label": "bad review"}

I will have to tuck it away so I don't take sneak peeks at the upcoming pages!\n\nThis calendar, as always, is constructed of nice grade paper and a sturdy plastic holder, which is to be recycled at the end of the year.  It will tuck nicely into any little nook or cranny available where you can keep track of the days with a good laugh or two.\n\nMr. Hilburn never fails to make me laugh -- his ideas, drawings, thoughts, are so funny and yet so down-to-earth and easy to related to.  When I worked, I cannot tell you how many times I would bring in a page that reminded me of a friend or a work situation.  His characters on each page are so well drawn and detailed.  Some of them make me laugh all day long.  And that's what it is all about.\n\nNot only do you get a laugh-a-day cartoon page each day, but on the back of that page is a nifty item called THE DAILY EXTRA.  These consist of bonuses -- puzzles, jokes, lists, quotes, life tips and trivia.  Each calendar page is in color and bright and eye-catching.  The cartoon is to the left -- on the right there is a white open area where you could easily jot down appointments, birthdays, events, and then below that is the day of the week, the numbered day of the month and the month itself.  Like stated earlier, the cartoons are so well drawn down to the finest detail and SO funny.\n\nIf you are looking for the perfect calendar that will make your day, keep you on track regarding the actual day and date, and add some color and laughs to your life, this is the one for you for 2018.\n\nScott Hilburn never disappoints  ARGYLE SWEATER is the ONLY day-to-day calendar I will purchase!", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I received a copy of this to evaluate.  I am so glad that I did.\n\nI have been homeschooling for about 15 years.  Homeschooling is rewarding, amazing, and terrifying.  The amount of chaos that goes with it is truly intimidating.  This is what makes homeschool moms a great target market for planners.  The homeschool planner market is chock full of gorgeous planners with zillions of lovely pages to use for journaling, book lists, inspiration, cute quotes, daily plans, long term plans, short term plans and every other possible page you can think of.  Keeping up the planners can be a full time job\n\nThis planner doesn't have that.  This is about as straight forward a record book as you could find.  It is for use by your student.  There is one page for basic identification and grade information.  There is one page to list the general syllabus for each course.  There is one page to list the texts used for each subject.  And then, there are 180 pages designed to record all your academic activities for each day.  Every possible category is listed in a way that encourages you to look not just at typical assigned seatwork but also at activities and field trips.  One page for one day.  There is nothing else to this book.  I wouldn't really want anything else except perhaps space for a reading record.\n\nIf you want a beautiful planner with inspirational quotes and lots of sections keep looking.  If you want a simple straight forward planner that will help with excellent record keeping by you and your student- get this one.  Heck, at under 6 bucks it isn't worth the trouble to make your own.\n\nI have just cancelled my (backordered) order for much more expensive planners for my kids and ordered 4 more of The Complete Homeschool Planner and Journal.  Simple is great.", "label": "good review"}

While we far exceed 5 hour days if we count everything we do I can easily keep track, kind of like a diary. With the subjects outlined it's easy for me to do back and see what we're not doing a lot or maybe spending too much time on a certain topic.\n\nIn the front you can mark of the days as you go and tally each month. I keep a running total so I can see exactly where we stand. For my own purposes to stay on track...at the end of each month I divide the remaining months in the year by the number of days left in the year. That tells me the minimum number of days I want to school that month. We run January - December so my goal is to have a light summer with July off and December off.

I just need, well, a *planner*.  I had given up and made my own this year out of a three-ring binder and my own printed sheets; however, it was a lot of work and it takes up a lot of space.

{"words": "I ordered this Gilmour Full Size Zinc Pistol Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 573TF on a whim.  I had just placed an order for a spiral hose to put permanently in the boat for wash down, and it popped up just below the confirmation of placing the hose in my cart.  I am a buyer who looks a many items of the kind I am considering, but I just clicked on this and placed it in my cart and sent in the order.  When I put the two together and screwed them onto the fitting in the back of the boat, hit the bait well switch only a small trickle of water came out.  I had screwed the nozzle on tightly to the hose fitting with a wrench, so it would not come off the hose without another wrench handy and I had left it in the garage at home.  So I am still not sure if the hose or this nozzle is the problem.  I will revisit this review after finding out for sure which it is, as I know it is one of the two of these devices that is the problem, since I removed the hose from the boat, turned on the switch again and water gushed out of the hose fitting on my boat, thus plenty of water pressure for the water to get through the hose and nozzle.  I change whichever is the culprit's review to reflect my annoyance.  I had hoped both of these items would be a trouble free solution to washing down my boat, but no, something had to foul up and cost me some grief.

It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!\n\nMy only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly e.g., it's not an even \"circle\" of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging.

I have one that is at least 30 years old.  The best part? you can operate it mostly with one hand.  Who thinks it is a good idea to put those fussy little PLASTIC on/off levers on things????. some are so small they are  hard to pinch and stiff to turn especially if you have grip issues.  This one you just release the handle lever and it stops.. no muss no fuss.  You can put it down without having to twist and/or struggle to turn it off.  It is ready to spray again with simple hand pressure .. again .. no wrestling or twisting required.\n\nMost all tarted up stuff today must be designed by people who never have to use the item..  A good, simple idea is always a good simple idea.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "There is only one thing wrong with this design:  the spray shape and the water volume can not be controlled independently. Better designs have one control for open-closed and another for spray shape. That makes this nozzle useless for filling buckets and other close applications. It is impossible to get high volume at low pressure output.\n\nThat said, the simple design is almost bomb-proof and the price is fair.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get \"prettier\" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if \"pretty\" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.\n\nTHUMB SCREW\nNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.\n\nLOCK-ON LOOP\nNotice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a \"lock on\" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.\n\nNOT A VALVE\nOne reviewer complains that there is no \"medium\" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual \"problem\", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is \"too good\"---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a \"closed\" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Melnor-390S-Hose-Shut-Off/dp/B00004SDYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Melnor 390S Hose Shut-Off</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gilmour-Brass-Garden-Hose-Connector-With-Shut-Off-Valve-03V/dp/B0006U66B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03V</a>&nbsp;just before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then \"open 'er up\" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.\n\nCOMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERS\nMany reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT \"Gilmour 572TF\".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in \"bargain bin\" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a \"Gilmour 572TF\", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the \"Gilmour 572TF\", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.\n\nCAVEATS\nHere in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hose&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Permatex-22058-Dielectric-Tune-up-Grease-3-oz/dp/B000AL8VD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Permatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.</a>&nbsp;If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.\n\nWhy not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)\n\nAfter 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.\n\nBut those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.\n\nALTERNATIVES\n> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dramm-12380-Heavy-Duty-Brass-Adjustable-Hose-Nozzle/dp/B001DGII5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle</a>.  These are virtually indestructible, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.\n> Those \"prettier\" versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter, and might get the wife's approval.  Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF, and in that case are clearly better choices.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gilmour-572TFR-Commercial-Insulated-Grip-Nozzle-with-Threaded-Front-Red/dp/B0008JGSD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red</a>&nbsp;,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gilmour-Comfort-Grip-Nozzle-with-Threaded-Front-593-Black/dp/B0008JGSDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black</a>&nbsp;,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gilmour-572-Insulated-Pistol-Grip-Nozzle/dp/B00002N68M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle</a>.\n> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gilmour-Salt-Water-and-Marine-Nozzle-474S/dp/B000FK008W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S</a>\n> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in \"bargain bins\", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.\n> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gilmour-Pistol-Grip-Nozzle-327-Teal-Red/dp/B000XTH2FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red</a>\n> If you (or your wife) insists on a \"pretty\" nozzle with s electable spray patterns, I suggest the hybrid&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gilmour-Select-A-Spray-Comfort-Grip-Nozzle-594-Black-Teal/dp/B000CZ2ZNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Teal</a>&nbsp;or Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  One setting is the full-action, and there are several selectable patterns.\n\nNERD CORNER\nThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will \"sacrifice\" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).\n\nWhat about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.  I know this for a fact---my wife keeps buying them---indeed we have a bin of discarded (mostly still functional) \"pretty\" sprayer nozzles, which have \"fallen out of favor\" for various reasons.\n\n> Click on Stoney just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.", "label": "good review"}

I returned it and bought another one that arrived with a chip in the blade. What?! I requested one last replacement and it is perfect. It is identical in quality and heft to my original purchase - the one I lost. I am so happy to have one again, and one that works. Shouldn't have taken three tries to get a good one, but at least I have it now. Love these shears and use them every day, along with when I mow.

It's my \"go-to\" tool I carry in my back pocket\n\nThe good news is that it's been slightly improved (you could not tell the difference in performance in spite of what the manufacturer states). The bad news is so slight you can't tell the difference but the price is about 30% higher.  It's Swedish made so part of the increase is the demise of the dollars decline vs European states.", "label": "good review"}

My dog is 8 years old and it was getting more difficult to jump up on the sofa, he would get stiff a lot and have to stretch before moving and he didn't run as much and couldn't walk very fast either.\nWell, that has all changed. He is not only jumps on the sofa, he can jump in the car again. And he is running fast again and his stiffness has disappeared. All of these improvements happened in just 3 weeks.\nI hope the new formula is just as good because this one is good as gold.\nVery cost effective since I only had to use 1/2 tsp/day!", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "UPDATE:  I am updating my review to alert people that it seems that this product has been discontinued, and that the closest formula to it that I've been able to find is Iams Premium Protection Adult Cat formula.  I hope this helps someone.  Iams owned the Eukanuba brand before both the Iams and Eukanuba brands were sold to P&G, and then P&G sold both the Iams and Eukanuba brands to Mars in 2014.  It seems that Mars has decided to just go with the Iams brand name for their cat foods, although the Eukanuba dog foods appear to still be available.  The cat foods are no longer listed on the Eukanuba website.  Since the same manufacturer owns both brands, hopefully the Iams brand will be just as good.\n\nOriginal review:  I ordered a bag of Eukanuba Adult Cat Chicken Formula from Amazon. I used to feed the Eukanuba chicken formula and the Eukanuba lamb formula a few years ago with great results, but my local pet supply store quit carrying it. After I could no longer find Eukanuba, I switched to Iams Premium Protection for a while, but the local pet supply store stopped carrying that except in the small, expensive by weight bags, so then I switched to the Science Diet Mature Indoor formula after carefully checking the ingredients list. After Science Diet changed their formula to include cheap and nasty wheat gluten which is nothing except a cheap filler that adds no value whatsoever to the food, I am so glad I ordered the Eukanuba cat food. On Eukanuba once again after a few years, my cats' coats have become incredibly, noticeably silkier than on the other foods. My cat that is sensitive to wheat no longer has watery eyes and dirt stuck to the inner corners of her eyes due to the watering caused by wheat sensitivity, and her stools are not loose at all. Amazon has the Eukanuba chicken formula at a great price right now, and with free shipping, the price can't be beat. The best way to purchase these foods is in the largest size bags as it is less expensive by weight that way. I will keep buying Eukanuba whatever it takes to do so because it gives my cats the absolute best health.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "If you have a sweet, loving fluffball that metamorphoses into a feral hellcat when confined to a small space, you've just found the perfect carrier!  You know the drill: you have to trick your cat into entering the tiniest room in the home, containing both you and the dreaded carrier.  Closing the door triggers a biochemical reaction deep in your fluffy sweetheart's brain and next thing you know, a terrifying physical transformation has taken place and you're trying to corral a puffed up ball of volcanic anger and tiny whirling knives into the soft-sided rectangular prison of hellcat's worst nightmares.  If you survive this heroic endeavor, you face another challenge: how to prevent imminent escape.  Keeping the carrier in one piece is an equally important goal, of course.  Hellcats laugh in the face of most soft-sided carriers: their flimsy mesh disintegrates at a steely glance, thin nylon or canvas sides melt like butter beneath razor claws, and weak zippers part like the Red Sea if hellcat even thinks of making a break for it.  But hellcat has met her match in the Sherpa Ultimate Bag!  The only devastation my hellcat has managed to wreak on her Sherpa is in the form of a shredded fleecy mat.  This hellcat owner recommends replacing it with something more substantial, or tossing a blanket over it.\n\nYou could use a plastic carrier as transport, and I'm sure someone out there reading this is wondering that exact thing, but hellcats take even less kindly to carriers with barred doors that invite inquisitive dogs at the vet's office to inspect their mobile prison.  Hellcat wants to travel as inconspicuously as possible, and the multiple flaps act as iron curtains between their burning resentment and the world at large.  Strips of industrial-strength mesh near the top of the carrier let in plenty of oxygen, keeping hellcat's mind sharp and fresh...as sharp as the claws that will soon be shredding your tender flesh, and fresh as the blood that will soon be pouring from your wounds.\n\nSo, in other words, I highly recommend it!  I'd give it a solid 5 stars if the fleece mat was thicker and more hellcat-proof.\n\nIf hellcat has to stay in her carrier unsupervised for any length of time, I use twist ties to secure the zippers - just in case.  I've seen her do her worst to the carrier to no avail, but I don't like to take chances.  You can turn your back on hellcat, but then you'll always wonder what evil may be lurking in the shadows...\n\nOh, by the way, once hellcat has resumed her normal sweetie pie form, she will seek out her Sherpa for naps!!  It's just the right size for her elooongated 10 lbs. body.", "label": "good review"}

I have trained my dogs to walk without pulling and by the third time on the flexi-leash they were all starting to pull--not good.

If you are in the middle of a board or piece of plywood then you have to try to hold them so they don't jerk a knoch out of the board. Also they are loud and noisy. I use a head set so the noise does not effect my thinking - consentration about what I am doing. This Makita has better winding on the motor and better brushes so is purrs to life and you don't have to worry about it jerking in your hand. It is also quite. It feels balanced and is simple to cut with, of course the blade you use is everything. The aluminum housing is great too, it is a snap to line up a cut and keep it lined up through the board.

The orbee ball is super!!  The dogs love the squishy, chewy quality. The rope lets me throw it farther, however I don't like the tied rope. I find any loops to be dangerous for active excited dogs.

{"words": "This toy is the best - for my cat. He is a very lively 7 month old kitten and out of all the plush toys I have gotten, this one is his favorite. The size is great for him to drag around by the neck like he is a lion with a fresh kill. He will groom it all lovingly, then roll around biting and kicking it with his back legs. He really seems to like the texture of the fur. He has managed to get one ear off, but it is standing up well otherwise. If he starts biting us with rough play, we just redirect him to this toy, and it is training him not to chew on us.\n\nTIP: get a blue one, (available at that big box store that starts with a W) it is the color cats and dogs can see best. Every other color looks very similar to each other to them. We got a regular white one, but I thought that was interesting.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I had tried the DSL for the last year and I just dropped it and went to cable. The one drawback was I lost my free McAfee and Spy Sweeper that came with the MSN DSL. After looking at a lot of the internet security programs out there I decided to try the Kaspersky since it had the highest customer ratings of all of them. Was that ever a mistake!\n  I downloaded the 1 month free full version of Kaspersky internet security 7.0. Even after uninstalling my McAfee and the free version of AVG that I had it still took two days and several tries to get the Kaspersky to install.\n  It took another day for it to run its updates and two more days to run all the full scans. I know my computer is old but its not THAT slow! Its an old DELL Optiplex GX240 running Windows XP Pro  with a 1.7 Pentium 4, 30 gig hard drive (80% full) and a 160 gig Seagate external (20% full).\n  Now when first starting to boot up my computer in the morning it takes at least 20 to 30 minutes for Kaspersky to stop taking up 100% of the CPU. And every time I try to do something it gives these pop-up warnings that some file or program is trying to do something to some other file. It stops everything until I tell it to let it do what ever or stop it. And I don't have a clue what the heck its talking about!\n  It has done something to my Internet Explorer too. Now its almost useless and it takes for ever to load a web page. And it keeps stalling and locking up for several minutes at a time. I'm using Firefox now to write this since it would take all day to do it in IE.\n  Every time I open one of my programs its the same thing. And now one of my photo programs wants to run its update and Kaspersky has a pop-up calling it Riskware and wants to Quarantine it. It did that last week and yesterday said it was a mistake and replaced the file.\n  So if you are the average computer user like me and don't know all that much about the different types of files, what they do, and all that, DON'T GET THIS PROGRAM! It will drive you nuts!\n  Now if you are one of those that can write programs, Walk, Talk, and Dream in computer language, then this program is for you. But then you wouldn't need it because you could write your own thats even better.\n  To use this program I think you would at least need to of had some computer programing class's in school. I would NOT recommend this program to any one and as soon as I can find something else to replace it I'm getting rid of it.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "I had a malicious 'worm' virus attack embed itself in my PC recently, so I had 'Geek Squad' fix the problem after my Windows XP system went 'haywire' and became unusable.  I have cable broadband and my 'Norton' anti-virus package let me down.  The 'GS' technician highly recommended I delete 'Norton' and go with the 'Kaspersky Internet Security 7.0' package, which offers total protection on so many levels (firewall, anti spyware, anti pop-ups, anti virus).  The installation was simple and everything works seamlessly.  I even have the 'Kaspersky' software allow advertising banners within websites I frequent, but disallow pop-ups.  PERFECT!  Moreover, I was told that 'Kaspersky' has been highly touted by all the PC magazines and online review sites, and it's not a 'memory hog' like other packages, thus not slowing down one's online surfing experience.  This bears out, since there has been no noticeable slowdown when i'm online.  What a relief to now know I have maximum security in place while i'm online, and not even noticing it since it works so seamlessly in the backround!  HIGHLY recommended!\n\nADDENDUM and UPDATE to my review; March 27th:  It is a few days after I initially posted my review, and I feel impelled to add to the accolades for this incredible product!  My wife's PC has been 'disabled' by viruses, spyware, and pop-ups to the point where it has been unusable for months now.  After having good luck with 'Geek Squad' with my PC as described above, we were going to call them and probably spend a few hundred dollars more to get her PC operational.  But before we called 'Geek Squad', I thought to myself why not try installing Kaspersky in her computer, and see if I could run a complete system scan to get rid of viruses and spyware that had slowed down her PC to almost a standstill.  Amazingly, Kaspersky detected close to almost 300 'infections', and either deleted or quarantined/neutralized ALL OF THEM!  This product is utterly AMAZING, and in one simple system scan, FIXED my wife's PC!  It now works like new, and we have Kaspersky running to keep things this way.  And we saved a good amount of money by not having to call a tech.  I cannot say enough GREAT things about this software.  It is a GODSEND (and no, I am not affiliated with Kaspersky in any way)!!!\n\nFURTHER UPDATE:  It is now almost Feb 2009, and I installed another copy on my new Dell Vista PC.  Kaspersky works FLAWLESSLY in the backround, and my surfing speed is excellent.  Honestly, I don't even detect I have Kaspersky running.  It is amazing!", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I really wish this had worked...\n\nI had great success with using previous versions of Roxio Creator in the past - but this version 10 is the exception. It's not like I should be surprised, I read all the negative reviews here, but there were a couple of positive ones as well - so based on my previous experiences I took a chance.\n\nThe software installed fine, but even from the start I could tell that it ran slow... and it also slowed down my machine with all the stuff it was running in the background. I think I could have lived with that, as it did do a lot of what it was suppose to do. But the thing that made me uninstall it completely, was that it had the effect of making the audio of any video that was played in any player (like the regular Windows Media Player) play at a greatly reduced level. Even with all the settings cranked up to 11, you could barely hear the audio. And even worse, it had the same effect on anything that I tried to record - no matter what program you used. Systems sounds work fine, just the playback / recorded audio was affected. I tried everything to fix this audio problem - updated everything, downloaded drivers and reinstalled. Nothing worked. Uninstalled the complete Creator 10 package and now everything works fine! Just like it did before I installed the software. Well, I'll keep the software on the shelf for now - maybe some day they will get around to releasing a patch to make it work.... Just in case someone wonders, I'm running XP, not Vista.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "I have nicknamed this software Bugmaster.  It lightened my wallet by $100 at Circuit City.  I needed a program to edit a DVD home movie on a crash basis.

I had owned a Roxio product 5 or 6 years ago, so I tried logging onto their website to see if there was a bug fix, but because I could not remember the ancient password, no luck there either, and although they said they had emailed me a new password, they had not.\n\nFact is, I am tired of software vendors that do this--they package a bug-ridden and downright inoperable software program hoping to sucker users into buying it, with the intention of putting their users through some god-awful time consuming patching process.  They have to know that their software does not work.\n\nAvoid this product.  I would not want it even if it were free.  My time is not free.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "I used one of the very early versions of Roxio a long time ago and did not like their menu system so I switched to Nero, which at that time was a bare-bones simple CD burning application.  I have used Nero ever since as I watched it get bloated with more and more \"features\" that had little or nothing to do with CD/DVD burning.  Nero is truly several separate applications rather than a suite, and the CD/DVD burning portion is capable but very dated.  My new computer came pre-loaded with Roxio Creator 9 so I have been using it for several months and had no problems with it.  I liked some of the new features of Creator 10 when it was introduced but was completely scared away by all of the negative, and even hostile, reviews.  Recently I was able to buy it for 39 after rebates and figured I couldn't go wrong for the price.  After using it for a while here are my first impressions:\n\nThe variety and usefulness of the included applications is amazing.  Even at full price I think it is one of the best software bargains in the world.  I have tried each of the apps, though not in depth, at this point and they each work.  My favorite is the audio capture function.  Unlike everything else out there that requires several steps to capture audio, Creator 10 installs a widget on your screen in which you simple press a red \"record\" button to capture a clip.  After the capture is completed you are taken to a very easy to use audio editing screen where you can trim and equalize your clip before saving it to a variety of popular formats.  This application alone is worth the price of the entire bundle.\nAlso included are a competent backup program, nice media player (but come on, who needs another media player with Microsoft, Apple and Real dominating the market?), label creator, media manager (a cool app that catalogs all those unlabeled CD/SVD disks you have laying around), apps to easily create music and video compilations, a nice photo editing app plus a panorama photo stitcher, a pretty capable video editing program (although I'm puzzled why it can't read FLV files), a cassette/LP converter tool, and about 10 more highly useful tools.\n\nNegatives?  Well first of all I will semi-dispute what several reviewers have said about it freezing their system on installation.  I thought so too, and then realized that a full install was loading over 50,000 files into my computer and even though I have a very powerful computer, the process took almost 45 minutes, making it the longest load time for any software I've ever owned.  Where Roxio messed up is that the install screen only has a simple message that \"installation may take several minutes\".  There are long periods ... like a couple of minutes at a time ... where the status bar does nothing and you would swear your computer is frozen.  You just have to have a lot of patience and resist the urge to terminate the install, which may be why some people have had so much trouble with the software.  Roxio could save a lot of frustration by making the install process a little more clear.\nMy other concern is that my anti-virus and anti-spyware programs (from two different companies) both identified Creator 10 as mal-ware.  I would like to know more about what information Roxio is gathering from my computer and how they are using it.  Software companies should be more open with their customers about such things.\n\nBottom line is that I don't think Creator 10 is as bad as some people make it out to be.  Today's computers are incredibly complex and there seems to be a tendency to blame hardware or software for lack of understanding of how computers work.  Other than your operating system, Creator 10 is probably one of the most complicated things you can install on your computer and there is no doubt it will have a noticeable effect on performance.  If you choose to go with Creator 10 make sure you have a very capable system with plenty of hard drive space and as much memory as you can afford.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I think overall the positives outweigh the negatives.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I guess I'm a lone voice crying in the wilderness because I like this product.  I can't say that I've used every one of the dozens of features this software includes, but I haven't run into any problems so far - and it's nice to know that I now have the capability to do so many other things I would never have even thought about doing before.  The main draw for me was the video editing and DVD creation features - everything else in Roxio Easy Media Creator 10 Suite is just icing on the cake for me.  That being said, you are going to need a pretty good computer to make all of this magic happen. When I first got this product, I had a five-years-old XP machine with limited memory.  I had no trouble installing the software, but I was very limited in what I could do, especially in terms of video editing.  Now I have a Vista PC with 4 GB of RAM, which means I am pretty much ready to Roxio and roll.  I did have some trouble installing this on my new PC, but that was because my PC came with Roxio Creator DE and I didn't want to uninstall that until I knew this new software was working problem-free.  All I had to do to get past this was to kill my preexisting Roxio processes in the Task Manager before installing this new software.  It was easy to do - my only complaint was that I had to figure this out on my own, as it wasn't mentioned in the documentation.\n\nSo what all can this puppy do?  Let's start with the video options.  You can capture video directly or import it from your digital camcorder, rip it from your non-encrypted DVDs, edit it, save it, export it, watch it, convert it, etc.  You can even upload videos to YouTube in one quick step.  Now I can finally transfer some of my old analog video to digital - up until now, I could transfer video to DVD, but I couldn't transfer it to my computer or edit it at all.  That means I'll finally be able to post some video of my late, beloved canine buddy on YouTube.  You don't have to be a total AV geek to do this stuff, either.  If the thought of turning your old home video into a \"movie\" scares you, you can just make a few basic choices and let the software do it for you.  All of the advanced video editing features will still be there when you're ready for them.  This isn't the most powerful video editing software in the world, but it's more than most of us will ever need.  I just want to be able to share my home videos with family and friends, not try to follow in the footsteps of George Lucas.\n\nYou also have a lot of nice options for working with photos.  If you already have a good photo editing program like Photoshop or Fireworks, Roxio's Photo Suite has nothing to offer you, but it's a good, basic editor for newbies.  You can also create slideshows, panoramas, and other types of photo projects with this software.  Again, many users will already have bigger and better ways of doing the same thing, but I certainly don't begrudge the fact that these options are included here - and some will definitely find these things of use.  The same goes for the Roxio Media Manager, which includes the ability to synchronize photos and videos with any mobile device you might have.\n\nTurning to audio, you get a myriad of features for ripping, burning, and organizing your files.  There's a Sound Editor that lets you add sound effects and/or edit and mix different audio tracks, a Batch Audio Converter that lets you convert your audio files to different formats, and a program that allows you to record analog audio from LPs and tapes (a Recording Setup Guide shows you how to hook the different components together).  If you're as old as I am, you have a lot of great music on LP and tape that you would love to have easier access to.  Roxio's Data and Backup utilities help you back up your important data files, a Disc Gallery lets you index all of the files on your discs, and Express Labeler and Label Creator make it easier to keep your discs organized.\n\nI've just tried to give you a quick overview of the many different features included in this software package.  Suffice it to say that this thing will give you plenty of bang for your buck.  Chances are that you're going to have different software programs you prefer to use for different things, but Easy Media Creator Suite 10 is such a complete package of products that you're sure to find a use for it in a number of different ways.  I might still use ITunes for my music, Fireworks for my photo editing, and Windows Movie Maker for some of my video editing, but I'm still quite happy with this software package.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "[Update 1/14/08] It would seem I am no longer among the lucky.  The application stopped working for me over the weekend.  Launching MyDVD put me into a never-ending loop of Windows Installer popping up.  I haven't touched the configuration of EMC-10.  Trying a repair in Control Panel | Add/Remove programs failed asking for files on a network.  I can no longer create DVDs without getting one of many obscure error codes.  The knowledgebase article at Roxio support about the installer loop said I needed to completely uninstall the product from my PC and reinstall.  The uninstall took forever because of the myriad of components EMC-10 installed without a unified uninstaller.  I am definitely NOT reinstalling this software.  I have never had an experience like this with any software package I've installed.  No way I am putting up with it.  I will be requesting an RMA today.  I am going to try Adobe instead.  At least they have a 30-day trial without having to pay up-front.  ZERO STARS!\n\n[Original review:]\nI downloaded the install for EMC-10 and was able to install the software, get it to run without crashing and produce a nice DVD from movie clips and a photo slideshow complete with background music.  This is the only part of the suite I've used so far and it worked brilliantly.  I would even say it was \"quick\" and I am using a Dell 9300 laptop with a Pentium M 1.6GHz processor and only 1GB of RAM.  I live in fear of trying the other parts of the application until I upgrade to 2GB.\n\nThe DVD burning and editing went much faster than MyDVD 5.5 and actually worked unlike MyDVD 9 (see below).  The end product is really good looking with only a few issues.  The things I don't like about the final DVD product is that the main menu music will not play for more than 60 seconds and the highlighted menu suffers from all kinds of aliasing problems with the font.  I also noticed the first few notes of any background music for a menu is lost.  The video quality is very nice taken from Motion JPEG files and 3ivx MPEG-4 files from a Canon 850is and Flip video camera, respectively.  The background music sounds great encoded as AC-3.\n\nThe nightmare was all before getting EMC-10 installed when I upgraded from MyDVD 5.5 to MyDVD 9.  Today a software package is no good without a good website, documentation and tech support.  So, while this part might not seem relevant I would beg to differ.  First, I had no clue that EMC-10 included MyDVD 10 or I certainly would not have bought MyDVD 9.  Nothing in the EMC-10 product pages indicated MyDVD was inside and version 10.  I also didn't know that MyDVD 9 would not support the files recorded from my Flip video camera.  Once again, nothing on the website saying that it does not support 3ivx MPEG-4.  Nothing on the website indicated any of this.  I figured it out reading the forums from other users.\n\nIf anything does go wrong with EMC-10 I already know I am hosed trying to use their website, documentation or support.  I am still waiting for a response from their customer support on my refund for MyDVD 9.  The instructions on their website for getting a refund don't work at all.  It can't even find my order number.\n\nFive stars for the product features that I've used and minus two stars for the website behind the product.\n\n[Update:] Roxio has a click-to-chat feature on their website.  I got a service rep right away and he gave me a phone number to call Digital River - the Roxio online store.  I called the number and after about 3-4 minutes on hold talked to a friendly agent who promptly sent me to a link where I clicked a couple of buttons to get my refund.  I got an email today confirming my refund for MyDVD 9.  No questions asked.  If only my call later with Comcast had gone so easy :-).", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "Roxio's latest version of their ubiquitous Media management/tinkering package - \"Easy Media Creator,\" is now on their 10th version which begs the question - is the upgrade worth it?  Depends on your needs.  If you are starting from scratch and looking for an all-in-one media package to do any or all of its commonly associated tasks (ripping and burning cd's, basic image enhancing, video editing, dvd authoring, etc.) then this program may be a good starting point for you provided that you can purchase it with a nicely discounted price.  For users who are thinking about upgrading from previous iterations of this program perhaps its time to start looking anew as most of the upgrades from versions 8 or 9 are somewhat minimal and not essential in my books.\n\nOne of the chief problems with this software suite is that while it excels at providing a solution for just about every media task the average home user needs on their computers the truth of the matter is that with a bit of digging around their are far better (and oftentimes free) software out there that makes some of Roxio's package seem awkward and out of date.  For instance, why bother with Roxio's music management system when iTunes is available for free as well as Google's Picassa for photo management?

Now that I have worked with it more I have had some of the same frustrations others have expressed but have located the source of the problem.\n\nThe software hangs, can't be stopped using process manager or with any other tools, etc.  However, this only occurs when I have my SanDisk usb thumb drive attached.  As soon as I pull it out everything works fine.  Plug it in and things hang almost immediately.  Same thing with an external usb hard drive (Maxtor).  As soon as it is unplugged everything is fine.  Working without any usb hard drives it works perfectly.  For me this is not a problem as I just work and save things locally and then transfer them to the usb drive later after closing the program if I really want it onto the drive.  I'm guessing that is the difference between those who have glowing reviews and those who think it is trash with nightmarish problems.  I have experienced both and at least now have control of the experience so I always have a positive one.  Hope this helps others experiencing some of these problems.\n\n*** Original review ***\nInstallation of Easy Media Creator 10 was straightforward and I had no problems.  After a quick reboot I was glad to find there are significant improvements over previous versions.  Somehow they have added more options while increasing the ease of use.  This is no easy task as added options just increase choices and the complexity of the program.\n\nOf course it has all the basic features you would expect from a consumer grade product but it also has several more advanced items that you might not expect.  While it does not reach the point of being an appropriate product for professionals, it never claims to be either.  Instead it is simply one of the best high-end consumer grade media suites available.  This being said it does not alienate the true novice but has many wizards and a clean interface so people with very little experience in media creation, enhancement, conversion, or other tasks can easily get the results they want.\n\nThe software did exactly what I had expected with just a few of exceptions.  The HD and Blu-ray support is not as extensive as some other competitors.  If this is a major factor for you then you may be disappointed.  The AutoFix in the photo enhancement section did fix exposure and sharpness but the color correction could get severely off if there was also an exposure adjustment.  I tried AutoFix on a picture of a Moon Jellyfish stranded on the sand.  The clear jellyfish had some light tinges of color due to refraction of the sunlight.  The sand was a dark gray color.  By the time the AutoFix had adjusted the photo the jellyfish was appropriate but the sand was changed to a surreal bright purple.  Finally, the propaganda for the product indicates that you can create ringtones from your favorite sound files.  Despite the instructions in the help file I was unable to do so and found that one of the choices that, according to the help file, was supposed to be there after a right click was not one of the choices available.\n\nOn the other hand parts of the program worked better than expected.  The panorama creation tool was one of the easiest I have used and did an excellent job.  Of course, I did start with good photographs to begin with.  For the video editor in you the package includes both CineMagic, a video editor directed more toward the novice, and VideoWave which is a more complete editor for more demanding projects.  Finally, the audio conversion tools were excellent.\n\nThe bottom line here is this software is highly recommended to everyone from the novice user to the serious hobbyist.  For this group of users it is the best suite of products I have worked with.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10 is packed full of features that you will come to love, but has one huge drawback -- the installation process is horrid to say the least.  I'd have no problems at all rating this a 4 or 5 star product if not for the installation woes.  However, once you get past that the program really excels in providing a full suite of digital media tools that are sure to please any Windows user.\n\nOne of the drawbacks to digital media, especially on the Windows platform, has always been how many programs you have to use to get something simple done -- such as create a movie and burn it to DVD.  With so many households using digital cameras and camcorders nowadays, the Windows platform has really lagged behind in having a tool set to help these digital households create, manage and share their media.  With Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10 you get a full arsenal of programs to help you make this task a little easier.\n\nHome users want software that is simple and gets the job done.  I'm happy to say that Roxio fits this bill.  I've used a variety of programs over the years to manage and share my footage from my camcorder.  They all have worked reasonably well, but they never provided a complete package to work with.  In Roxio, I found a lot of tasks that were tedious to do with other programs -- such as adding overlay tracks with text or audio -- was a snap to do.  The first video I produced with Roxio, my review of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Logitech-Cordless-Desktop-Wave-Set/dp/B000TKHGL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Logitech Cordless Desktop Wave Set</a>, took less than 10 minutes to produce.\n\nHowever, this program suite is more than just a digital movie maker.  You will also find a wide array of tools to help manage your digital audio, create data CD's and DVD's (including burning ISO images) and programs to help you even manage content from your mobile devices!  For the price you pay you really are getting quite a bit of software to help you manage your digital tasks.\n\nAnother plus to this suite of programs is that it can grow to meet your needs.  You can start out simple, such as getting your video off your camcorder and making a simple movie with the CineMagic program.  As you get more familiar with video editing the program lets you control almost every aspect of it by giving you the controls to edit track-by-track, clip-by-clip and scene-by-scene.  Advanced users will like the ability to have total control over their media, while newcomers will enjoy the wizards and walkthroughs provided by the product.\n\nOverall, Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10 is a great family of products that will help you take control over digital life.  The only thing to watch out for, and why I gave it three stars, is the installation process can be extremely problematic -- especially under Windows Vista.  Be prepared for extremely long wait times without any feedback as to what is going on.  Hopefully, Roxio will address these concerns and fix this problem to make this product worthy of 4+ stars.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "This program took about 45 minutes to load on my two-year-old IBM laptop running XP.  The computer not only meets the system requirements but also meets the recommended standards, so there shouldn't have been a problem.  However, the review materials suggest that it was designed around Vista instead of XP, and that may explain its slowness.\n\nThis software has also proved to be a remarkable memory hog.  I'm used to multitasking and switching between programs, and I just can't do that when using this product.  It doesn't even swap well between its own features.\n\nBut that's enough complaining about the slowness - - how well does it let you manipulate sounds, pictures, and so on?  To test this, I set myself two simple tasks: to set a slideshow to music, and to create a panorama out of several photos.  The slideshow task was simple and menu-driven, and easy to do.  The software imported the pictures and the music very slowly, and the project was slow to save, but it looked very nice when all done.  However, I could have done the same thing in PowerPoint.\n\nThe second task also worked well, and was much more impressive.  I had four pictures of a dune that I wanted to piece together.  I had not originally taken them as a panorama, so the pictures had somewhat different focal lengths and exposures.  Some overlapped a little, others a lot.  The software has an automatic panorama tool that fit three of the four pictures together well.  It was a little off on the last seam, but a \"fine tune\" tool allowed me to get it closer manually, and then the software finished the seam off.  Some seams were easy, requiring only that the software identify \"dune,\" \"water,\" and \"sky.\"  However, I was particularly impressed by the more difficult seams, which required getting brown grass stitched together right, as well as an area of leafy shrubs.  Very impressive.\n\nThe software also uses irregular stitches, so that there isn't a hard line between pictures.  One of those seams more or less disappeared, and the others look OK, given the poor raw material that I gave the program.\n\nYet again, simple tasks were slow.  It took me five minutes to save the panorama and then open it in the photo editor.  The photo editor was also very intuitive and easy to use, and I was able to fiddle with the brightness and contrast of the resulting panorama.  Those tasks, too, were slow to load, but sped up with use (presumably because of caching).  Save times got down to 30-35 seconds, which is OK but slower than other software I've used.\n\nAll in all: I'm impressed by what it can do, and how well it can do it, but it's frustratingly slow.  I'll use it for challenging projects and use simpler tools for routine ones.", "label": "bad review"}

It worked quite well, but, as can be expected, the sound quality is not excellent. Still, it was pretty decent. And it may have more to do with my sound card than this software.\nThe other features were pretty user-friendly to use. I tried making a new movie slide show from miscellaneous movies/photos, and it was quite easy to do.\nAll in all, if you can get past the installation problems, it's not a bad product.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "[4.5 Stars]\nThe installation setup process crashed both my laptop and desktop initially. That said, I contacted Roxio and they rushed an overnight replacement copy to my house. For that reason and the fact the program performed as it said it would, I upgraded my rating from two stars to four and a half. In addition, I learned from Roxio that the DVD they'd sent out had had duplication problems that caused some errors in installation. The production DVDs in the retail version do not have this problem, something I found out first hand.\n\nI used to perform most of the operations in the suite with other programs, but the convenience of having it all in one place is great. For the price, it's incredible the different things an owner of Easy Media Creator Suite 10 can do!\n\nI did run into some issues, the one I remember being that hitting the \"autofix\" button in the Photo Editor made the picture of my wife and sister-in-law turn a strange, nuclear-reactor cobalt blue. It could have been because they were both wearing black jackets and it was twilight when I took the picture, but \"autofix\" definitely did not fix anything. Working with the individual tools however, I was able to make the proper changes to the color and sharpness, etc.\n\nThe music properties of the suite (in the \"Audio\" section) were the usual with some interesting things that I would normally never work with thrown in: I could, for example, digitize the audio off tapes and LPs. I don't own any of those, but for those who do, that would be a really good thing to have. Again, this is functionality that can be obtained in some other standalone tools, but here it is, conveniently in one piece of software. Of course, I can rip music, create music DVDs and CDs and all the other goodies we've come to expect from Roxio.\n\nIn the video section, here's where the new Creative Suite really shines. I've never really been comfortable creating my own videos and all, but I was quickly able to use the \"Roxio Video Compile and Convert\" to create custom DVDs. I was able to import video chapters from one DVD and combine in with video I downloaded from YouTube, place those two in different chapters and burn an new DVD. The really fun thing is, it didn't take a lot of studying the manual or help pages. Doing anything you wanted to do in the Suite generally is easy because it's almost intuitive. I really liked this about it.\n\nI had some problems with it transferring information to my iPod, but for all I know, that may be user error. I will have to look back into this. The photo tools are also great.\n\nIn summary, for the price, you can hardly go wrong with this product. It's very good; the only reason it's not at five stars is because of the earlier problems I had installing the product in addition to some slowness I experienced from time-to-time while using it, although that could be my laptop.", "label": "good review"}

It took us longer than I even care to think about to get this loaded up and ready to go on our system. Once we had everything working, we were warped into a vortex of overwhelming options, half of which we couldn't get to work and another quarter of which were complicated and not worth it, as we had no use for them anyway. We were able to use the photo editor and clean up some photos, then create a pretty cool slideshow with musical background. Afterwards, we successfully edited a video and posted it to YouTube with relatively little hassle. We also played around with several of the other features we could get to work and, while relatively impressive, we could not see ourselves using them on a regular basis. The multimedia capabilities of this product are seemingly endless, and if you could see yourself using most of the features this gives access to, I would HIGHLY recommend it. However, if you just need one or two of these features, or if you run XP, I can not recommend this product.", "label": "bad review"}

I have about 700GB of files on my PC that need backing up, and USB 2.0 was just taking WAY too long, so I purchased a new Seagate FreeAgent 750GB external hard drive with eSATA connection.  (For those of you unfamiliar with eSATA, it has become the new standard for high speed PC backups to external drives ... most benchmarks show 3-5x faster than USB on actual transfer speeds.) Anyhow, Microsoft is VERY misleading when they say OneCare will backup to any \"external drive\", because it will NOT back up to an eSATA drive.  This is because eSATA connects directly to the SATA ports on the computer motherboard, which means OneCare can't tell the difference between your normal internal drive and the eSATA drive.  So, it ignores them all!", "label": "bad review"}

Just stunned that there is ANY gold stars - let alone more than one.\n\nLet's just say that I hold highly suspect anyone who writes a glowing review of this garbage-software.  They either are \"lite\" computer users or they are drinking the Microsoft cool-aid (or taking a mind altering drug).  I'm guessing that is was OneCare staff members looking for job security who filled out those posts speaking highly of this product.\n\nThe interface is horrible, simply bad, and you, as a user will have to spend added time \"learning\" it.  So if you're into spending those free hours of yours getting used to the way some incredibly poorly skilled user-interface designer at Microsoft has designed things - then great - everyone should have a hobby.\n\nYeah, when they say this is for 3 computers - it doesn't mean that if you buy two it is for 6 users (and so on)- like one might conclude.  Nope. Microsoft in a stellar moment of short-sightedness decided to cripple the software's ability to scale beyond 3 computers - no matter how many licenses you buy.  [actually you *can* use this on more than 3 machines; there are \"work-arounds\", but you will loose the \"uber-control\"- which is really what this is suppose to do.\n\nSo if you happen to be one of those folks who has more than 3 computers, or ever in your life expect you'll have more than 3 computers... then this is not for you (or anyone really).  -Just STUPID Microsoft, just stupid.\n\nLike being reminded of stupid things OneCare wants you to do... well good because this is a high-maintenance bit of software.  Frequently the software wants you to do things it's way - or it will not allow for the \"all clear signal.\" Flexible it is NOT.\n\nNorton/Symantec offer a competing product which is wwwwwwaaaaaayyyyyy better (and faster) than this (*&^%$#@!).  I had to figure this out the hard way.  I hope you don't.\n\nIf you think I'm joking/kidding/exaggerating...  check out how hard they make it to find the \"techical support phone number for OneCare\" - google it on the web and you'll find tons of angry users complaining about the very fact that you have to spend over 4 minutes and click 36 times through a series of help-dialog boxes (I tested this) before you can be provided a telephone number.  Yes, that's right, the user-interface is literally designed to prevent you from finding out what the tech-support number is(!) - so bad is it that when I had the Microsoft trained OneCare tech support staff member go through all the 36 clicks and so-on he got lost and couldn't find where to go to get the number (which would be to call himself more-or-less)...\n\nDon't buy this product.  That's really the kindest thing I can say about it to you.

{"words": "First encountered Microsoft's Windows OneCare in 2005 as a Beta project that I participated in. Wouldn't have gotten involved except that I had found Symantec's Norton AntiVirus to have become a real resource hog, and the products from McAfee weren't any better, despite their claims. I had been a loyal user of Norton AntiVirus since those days that Peter Norton was still running his innovative company, one that pioneered anti-virus applications as we know them... but that was then, and this was now.\n\nI dropped the Norton products after a series of problems that were well-documented in the 'computer geek' community, and began to install Grisoft's AVG Free anti-virus on some of my systems. About a year later Microsoft released it's Beta test of Windows OneCare, and that seemed to be a product with few bugs and a lot of promise. When the Beta test was over, however, I standardized my computers with AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition, and that continued until late last spring when I saw an associate's installation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Windows-Live-OneCare-2-0/dp/B000V6YPAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Windows Live OneCare 2.0</a>&nbsp;and listened to his reasons as to why why he had switched from Symantec's products.\n\nInitially I downloaded the trial version from Microsoft to test it out, but within two weeks had become convinced that this was not only a competitively priced product (other products have only recently caught up), but it's resource footprint was small. It didn't seem to interfere with normal operations or offer obnoxious reminders of how my computer was being protected.\n\nWindows Live OneCare runs quietly in the background, doing its job well and quite unobtrusively.

All of its updates run quietly via Microsoft Update, and this has kept my systems up-to-date with the important security updates.\n\nPros:\n\n* Very reasonable cost for what it does.\n* Runs quietly and effectively in the background.\n* Excellent monthly reports on activity.\n* Has an excellent two-way firewall.\n* Automated backups to external hard drive or USB storage devices\n\nCons:\n\n* OneCare interface is different, may seem somewhat awkward.\n* Other anti-virus and firewall programs need to be removed.\n\nThis product isn't perfect; no security application that I've encountered to date is. The occasional reboots for updates are irritating, but all applications of this type have them to work properly. The Windows Live OneCare interface is different, and may seem somewhat awkward until you get used to it, but it does function properly. Had laughed last spring when I read that OneCare had mistaken Skype (the Internet telephone application) for a piece of malware, but have see similar false reading from almost all of the anti-virus and security applications on the market over time.\n\nThe above remarks may sound picky, but they're really not; they're just a personal reflection of what I've found while I've used this product. But all things considered, and especially since it's so well-behaved as it runs quietly in the background, doing its job quite unobtrusively, Windows Live OneCare is a real 5-star application from my perspective.\n\nPlease note: I'll be posting helpful info about this product and possible updates in the Comment section below this review, so be sure to check there as well.", "label": "good review"}

However, when he leaves for college that won't be an option for him.  I wanted something that was easy to use and didn't bog his laptop down.  Unfortunately, although OneCare is a good product, it just didn't fit the bill.\n\nFirst off, let me say the product has a lot of nice features -- including automated backups, firewall, anti-virus and more rolled into one thing.  However, as I've learned in the past, sometimes rolling too many features into a product can give you a less than stellar offering.  It's hard to be the \"best\" in every category -- and I think this is where OneCare suffers.\n\nI found the Firewall to be terribly annoying.  I prefer to leave software-based firewalls turned OFF because hardware-based firewalls are much more reliable.  When I did this I got not one, but two red icons in my task area on Windows XP that would not go away.  Unlike the built-in firewall with Windows XP/Vista, turning OneCare's firewall off does not give you the option to ignore the condition and remove the red icons.  In this way I felt the program was way too demanding to be wanting to do everything when all I wanted was a subset of its features.\n\nNext, I noticed that the backup feature of OneCare and the backup feature of Windows Home Server was not integrating correctly.  The product states that it \"recognizes\" the backup feature of WHS, but I found out that two backups were trying to occur every night.  I searched around some and couldn't find any real documentation or options for fixing the problem.\n\nThe anti-virus feature worked well, and in fact seemed to run just a bit faster than my current anti-virus program, Avast.  Updates happened automatically and it was pretty much non-intrusive.  No complaints there.\n\nThere were other features that would be handy for novice users, such as cleaning up the temporary files that Windows and IE seem to leave around as well as a feature to scan your system for missed updates, etc.  Again, these are features a novice user might enjoy so they don't have to manage their computer as much.\n\nHowever, my overall impression was that OneCare is \"good\" but just doesn't make it into the \"great\" category.  I'd say if you have one or two PC's without a home network then this program will work for you just fine.  If you are a more tech-savy computer user then you'll probably find yourself fighting the program more than getting a lot of value out of it.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "Windows Live OneCare 2.0 introduces the managed services concept to home PC users. The software optimizes your PC with three closely related sets of programs:\n\n1. 'Protection Plus' includes virus and spyware monitoring, anti-phishing filters and firewall to help keep the bad stuff away from you.\n2. 'Performance Plus' optimizes your hard drive and repairs it in case something unwanted manages to get through or whenever you want to fine-tune your system; the set of utilities includes disk defragmentation, unnecessary file cleanup, scandisk for spyware/malware/viruses etc., and a check for security updates from Microsoft.\n3. 'Backup and Restore' helps you configure your home network of up to 3 PCs and backup to either CD/DVD or an external device located on your network.\n\nThe software is intended to be used with the Live OneCare service where the latest software such as anti-virus definitions are downloaded. Activating the service was easy, and running all three of the services takes only a few minutes. Since the initial install, I have found the minimal time spent maintaining the service to be worthwhile; for example, I set the protection and performance functions to run at night when the computer is not in use.\n\nWhile one might argue that is is possible to do some of the things that Windows Live OneCare does manually, the point is that you benefit from the software's automation of routine tasks which allows you to spend more time doing the things that you want to do. Additionally, it simply makes sense to be as proactive as possible and there is no better way to do that than to subscribe to a service that is continuously refreshed with the latest patches and security updates.

So I bought OneCare for my PC not really thinking about what I'd need it to do. Someone else had recommended that I try AVGFree, which worked just as well. Well OneCare lived up to my expectations, which were low. You can put this program on up to 3 PCs for virus, adware/spyware, and firewall protection. The software is easy to use, with a color coded bar that tells you your computer's overall health (green = good, red = better go buy a new computer). I have Windows XP and had no connectivity issues. This program seemed to detect things well enough, with no annoying pop-ups, and I haven't really had any problems. I'm not much of a PC guru, but I'd recommend this product to a friend. It comes with 24-hour customer phone support, which in my opinion is worth the price in itself.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "One of our children inherited a computer and the virus system was outdated. Along came OneCare to the rescue with its spyware detector, firewall and a regular checkup.\n\nIt took a very long time to load because there was so much junk on the computer, much of it needing to be deleted. But once the program was installed, the computer suddenly ran more quickly and plenty of viruses were gone, gone, gone! As noted, it maintains itself. So that is a major plus.\n\nHaving noted that, will this be the system YOU want? Maybe - or maybe not.\nThe ability to customize this and the automatic maintenance and upgrades give us some peace of mind. They work even when our offspring is asleep, protecting the system pretty well.\n\nWe don't like the annual fee, however. It isn't cheap! Also, some spam got by this program. Finally, it could not remove all \"potentially harmful\" programs. We had to do that manually and it was hit or miss for awhile, locking up the computer. In short, installation was not that simple.\n\nIn all fairness, however, we didn't put it on the newest computer. So take that for what it is worth and consider your options.\n\nIn summary, I would not call this the best all-purpose safeguard out there but it provides a reasonable degree of protection for those who aren't doing more than emailing or light use of the internet.", "label": "bad review"}

I uninstalled it, and immediately the laptop sped up again.\n\nIf your computer exceeds the minimum requirements (OneCare requires at least 256 MB of RAM; I wouldn't try it unless you have 512 MB or more), this is a pretty good anti-virus program.

{"words": "I can't imagine a greater level of disappointment than this product has given me.\n\nThe basic framework is there: virus protection, routine maintenance, automated backup, updates and security.  But I suspect that it will perform as needed only for those people that install it when the stars correctly align.  For woe unto you who have a problem.  Support may be there, but you'll work yourself into a frazzle just trying to find the support or get an answer.\n\nI'd like to think that I'm somewhere between the average computer user and the uber-geek that writes his/her own source code.  That said, I'm giving up on this product.  Let me tell you why.\n\nFirst, OneCare offers to set up your wireless security for you.  In my case, it made my wireless access so secure that I couldn't use it.  The double whammy behind that is the fact that the bulk of OneCare's support is ONLINE!  It's tough to get a question about online access answered, when you have to go online to get it and can't.  I searched high and low in the program for something that even remotely resembled a technical support number, no... something that even remotely resembled a telephone number!  But success was not to be had.  Finally, I pushed the reset button on my wireless router, turned off the wireless security firewall in OneCare and was able to go online again.  Help was via a discussion board, and the tech that answered my initial question was out sick when I asked for some clarification.  That delayed response by 4 days!  By the way, Microsoft claims that my particular router is fully compatible with OneCare.\n\nOkay, so the wireless security is no good, at least in my case.  But setting up an automated backup is a great idea right!  Sure, if... if... if you can find a storage device that OneCare is disposed to work with.  My thought (radical free thinker that I am) was that I would perform the initial backup by saving everything to a DVD, then using a lower storage USB stick for the incrementals.  OneCare saw the DVD drive but apparently didn't like it.  The USB stick didn't have enough space, so... can't use that.\n\nBut all is not bad.  OneCare did perform a tune-up for me that basically removed files that I removed manually from time to time.  And it's interface to control those programs that automatically load to memory on startup was nice.\n\nBut the bottom line is this.  It's a finicky product with no support for the panicky.

Not sure why there is so much downloading for an initial software install.

{"words": "I received this program through the Amazon Vine program. It came with a license to use it on three computers. My husband and I were both impressed with what the program said it could do. It sounded too good to be true. We installed it on two desktop PCs and one laptop.\n\nAll the computers were slowed down to a snail's pace. Starting up the computer took at least three minutes (and seemed like a lifetime). Opening each program took so long, minutes to open an application!  Opening my (popular) email application and waiting for the download to happen took forever. The process by which it scans each email for viruses apparently takes a lot of time. To cope I'd end up opening the program, walking away and returning later to read the email.\n\nEven using the computer doing simple tasks like changing to view the email program to use a word processing program was very difficult. I'd click on the other application and it would pause and nothing would move, then a minute or two later the screen would finally react. Flipping from one Internet browser to another would have long pauses and it `wouldn't go'.  Before installing this program I could flip to different Internet browser windows with immediate results. Trying to open new programs such as a spreadsheet program took forever and the cursor didn't seem to react, so I'd click on the icon again. In the end sometimes I'd end up with three of the programs open and ready to run.\n\nI had the worst experience with using a (popular) photo altering program. That program kept locking up.\n\nThe long time that it took to access different programs and to switch from viewing the Internet to the word processor made the most basic computer work painstaking and time consuming. It was ridiculous. I have not experienced a computer being this way since the early 1990s when I was accessing the Internet through dial-up! To cope with the computer being this way, I took to reading something on paper while I waited for the system to catch up so I could do whatever it was that I was trying to do.\n\nAlso when starting up the system each day I'd get an urgent message that there was a problem! Guess what `the problem'  was? I had new documents that needed backing up. Give me a break--that is no urgent or emergency situation.\n\nWe were so happy to uninstall this from all of our computers.

{"words": "Nero 8 Ultra Edition is the next submission in a long line of upgrades to the venerable line of cd/dvd editing/authoring software.  If you have a high def. video camcorder or other more recent hardware, the upgrade price may be worth your while to upgrade--for me I have found it not worth it.  Perhaps it is worth it for more Vista compatibility though, even though I don't use the special Vista features.\n\nPros:  You can do a little of just about any type of DVD/CD/VIDEO editing with this software--but don't expect Pinnacle Studio or Sony Vegas Studio features.  Greater Vista compatibility with some Vista features.  There is a slight improvement to the user interface.  Directly upload to YouTube and other video sharing websites.\n\nCons:  Requires you to buy more licenses for more than one PC even if not used concurrently.  Jack of all trades, but master of none--lacks the high end features in most cases that advanced users crave.  Downloading updates for the boxed version essentially turns it into the download version of Nero 8.  The main drawback to this is that your documentation (which is poorly done at best) is whiped out rendering you help button and drop down useless.  If you want to consult a manual you have to download each one and open them separately.  There is no printed manual to speak of included in the boxed version, and for a $100 peice of software I find that unacceptable.  I also was inelligible for upgrade prices because I'd previously purchased the download version.\n\nConclusion:  I find the fact that updates whipe out my help menu totally unaccepatable.

I have to agree with those who have written that if you have a functioning copy of Nero 7, and aren't looking to work with HD video, upgrading to Nero 8 is probably not worth it.  I use Nero Vision the most, and it is almost exactly the same as the prior version, if anything, a bit more difficult to use.\n\nI give this 4 stars because it's not perfect, but it's very easy to use, the menu navigation is easy, and the wide variety of options, from making backup DVDs to burning audio cd's, to editing video, is quite satisfying.

{"words": "I've used Nero for optical device recording/ripping needs since Version 5. I've tried other applications (Roxio and others), but for Windows users, previous versions of Nero have set the standard in this category of applications.\n\nVersion 8 shows some issues that Nero should *not* let continue:\n\n(1) The package can only be described as \"bloated\". The current downloadable version is over 180 MB. While this is not an issue if you have broadband, Nero inexplicably doesn't include the product's help files in the download content.\n\nSo, in order to use Nero's \"Help\" functions, you then have to download and install them separately. This is quite silly when the help file download size are less than 3MB in size! With the application installer approaching 200 MB, what's 2 MB among friends!\n\nNero's web site says leaving out the help files is deliberate \"in order to to keep the download file small\". Note to Nero: the download file is already huge...so please just add the help files.\n\nThe bloat comes in many forms, from a CD cover designer to Nero InCD.\n\nNote 2 to Nero: in these days of rewritable DVDs, 4GB flash drives and inexpensive hard drives, do you really think users would still choose a proprietary format CD/DVD packet writer for archiving or storage?), to Nero Home (which it claims can integrate your media streaming through multiple machines), the download, installation -and, ultimately, the overall experience of this product-- is compromised by a large volume of marginally useful applications that detract from what Nero does well: create and reformat data for optical media. Take the time to select the \"custom\" install option, and leave out those apps you don't plan to use.\n\n(2) Lots of waiting time. Nero installation takes a *long* time. Not a real issue if you only have to go through the process once. But: on a clean Windows XP machine, I had to go through it twice (due to some errors that crept up, directly related to the bloat described above and the Windows resource issues described below).\n\n(3) Slow to launch once installed. It takes a long time for Nero Version 8 applications to launch. Even if you have a fast processor and abundant memory: after you decide to launch the application, be prepared to wait before you start to rip and burn.\n\n(4) Unexplained Windows resource drain. Nero Version 8 runs a background process called \"NMIndexingService.exe\"  This process runs whether whether you've launched Nero or not. When other applications do this, it's often called malware. While this can be disabled by advanced Windows users using the msconfig tool, there's no obvious utility to this service, and no excuse for it being hidden deep in Windows. Shame on Nero for this. Nero's email response to a question about this I submitted took two weeks to arrive. The recommended  a reinstall of Nero...but first you have to download a separate utility called \"Nero Clean Tool\" and then reinstall that. Just as with the help files: an effective uninstaller routine should be a given for modern Windows applications.\n\n(5) For as widely used as Nero products are, their support website is remarkably uninformative.\n\n-Once you get past all this, once installed and launched Nero 8 still is great program for authoring CD/DVDs and ripping MP3s. But the issues above are hugely distracting, and Nero should have more respect for its customers than to make them jump through these hurdles.\n\n-Nero needs to get back to basics, trim the fat, and offer customers what  they really want, and what it does best: sound, fast CD/DVD writing. Nero  should include the help files, discard the less useful components, and respect users' Windows resources when they aren't engaged in its basic ripping and recording.\n\n-If you have a stable version of an earlier version: Don't move to Version 8.", "label": "bad review"}

I found that ver 12 installed with no problems and in no more then 15 minutes. I did what was instructed and had closed all other running programs during the install. I also created a restore point using system restore in case there were problems. After installing I took it for a fun test drive. After playing with it, and loving it. I will say that for a regular grandpa that takes hundreds of photos a year of the grandkids. This is one wonderful piece of software. I am using a 19\" Samsung model 906BW LCD monior with the resolution set a the factory recommend 1440X900. No trouble seeing the screen. Using a EVGA 7600 video card with 256mb ram. The computer itself has 2Gb Kingston HyperX PC 3200 DDR. Because some reviewers said the program loaded slowly when opened. I turned on that machine and after it booted I opened the program and timed it. 17 seconds. Yes seconds. So I can only imagine that the ones having trouble with the way the program loads must have a lot of other stuff running at the same time. It took only seconds also to save a picture that I cropped, removed redeye. and resized before saving. With earlier vers I have been able to do some wonderful things to old B&W photos taken back in the early 40's of my father during WWII as well as my mother and older brother and sister. I'm sure this new ver with only make playing around that more fun. If you are new to photo editing I believe you will not be unhappy buying this.

{"words": "I have mixed feelings about this product.  It has bailed me out from a C: disk crash.  However, I had many issues with the software (I will give examples below), support for problems is practically non existent (help only from the forums where other people are having the same issues)  and when the crash happened I had very little hope that it would work. But it did.  I now switched to a different back up method.\n\nWhen I bought this software, I wanted to have a backup history of about a month so I can go back to the old files if I made some sort of mistake.  My hope was to run a full back up once a week, and then have differential backs 6 times a week, this way I could fit 7 different backups on a large disk designated for backups.  The software claims to have a function that allows it to delete old backups based on a condition (% of disk full for example).  But that never worked. Many other people complained about the same problem.  When the disk became full, it simply stopped backing up.  I had to remember to manually free up disk.\n\nThen I upgraded to a next version of the software which was supposed to have these problems fixed.  However, the fix was to remove the functionality and what I wanted to do was not possible.  The new version still had problems with incremental backups at disk full situation.  In fact I left it double the amount of space necessary for one backup (as the forums indicated it needs temporary space while the backup is working).  Finally, the only solution that worked was to have a full back up every day, with a rule that the previous copy had to be deleted before the new backup was created.  Occasionally, it would still fail with messages that made no sense at all.  I could get it to work again sometimes, if I deleted several backups and ran disk defragmenter. But this did not always help.  And then in a few days it would begin working again.  So it felt fragile and unreliable.\n\nAs I was having various issues I contacted support several times (support is via email), they would get back to me in 2-3 weeks requesting some additional log file, to which they would respond maybe in another 2-3 weeks.  By then whatever they said was not relevant, because I could not just wait for 4-6 weeks for a possibly helpful response. I would just wipe out the backups and start all over.\n\nBecause the regular backups felt flakey, I also created \"secure zone\" back up, which is an option to have a backup on a separate partion.  When the disk crashed, restore from secure zone did not work.\n\nSo overall, using it was a very frustrating experience which was shared by a large number of other users based on the forum postings.  The forum was the only place where I could get ideas of for possible solutions, and validation that the problems I was having were not unique to me.\n\nHowever there are some positive things about the product\n1.  The feature that allows you to mount a back up and easily retrieve an old file as if it was just another volume is very nice\n2.  The backups are fairly quick. I tried using Windows native back up and on my disks it did not even completed in 24 hours.  Acronis backup for all my disk completed overnight (when it worked), when it did not it would sit at the prompt complaining about something with inscrutable message.\n3.  Finally, when the disaster struck and my c: drive crashed, I was able to do a restore my C: drive from the backup to a brand new drive and it worked.  I did not have to reinstall windows, all my settings and customization were preserved.\n\nBottom line, this is only for those who have no other options.  It requires constant baby-sitting.  You need to manually check if it worked on daily basis, delete files, and  just pay constant attention to it.

{"words": "I got this because the backup that comes with Vista Home Premium is useless, and it is ESSENTIAL to have a backup (I know from painful experience).\n\nI installed and used True Image 11 for several months, and now have uninstalled it because the size of the incremental backup I was having it do nightly was growing by 1 - 2 Gig per nightly backup, and had vastly exceeded the total size of what was being backed up.  I don't want to have to maintain that.\n\nIn addition, I don't like have the backup file in some proprietary format that I cannot easily use or verify.\n\nI discovered a free tool from Microsoft called SyncToy that synchronizes a set of files between 2 locations.  It doesn't compress or store things in a proprietary format - you get a mirror copy of your file set, which is just what I wanted.  It can also be set to run from the Task Scheduler.  So I use this for my nightly backup which is primarily all of the documents, photos, music, etc which is stored under my user name.  Because the backup on my other computer is an exact copy, I can easily look at those files to verify their contents.  The size never grows, and I can also make a copy to take with me and use remotely.  It was perfect and cost nothing.\n\nOne other thing I didn't like about TrueImage is that it would sometime start a process running (trueimagemonitor.exe) that would run for a long time creating tremendous disk activity, slowing everything down.  Once I uninstalled TrueImage (which wasn't easy - I had to use a 3rd party program to find and launch the uninstaller), my computer booted MUCH faster than before.\n\nMaybe these things been fixed in the new version - or maybe not - but I'm not using this anymore.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "I was using Norton Ghost to do backups and while that seemed to work okay, I really wasn't comfortable using a Norton/Symnatec product because I've found them all to be bloatware. So I gave Acronis a try.  I set it up using Windows XP and had no trouble installing the program, nor adjusting the settings to make my initial backup as well as scheduling regular incremental backups thereafter. I used the feature of the software that creates a secured partition on the backup drive that can't be accessed by the operating system.  This partition does appear to be secure because Windows Explorer doesn't see it, and it is immune to the format command, as well.\n\nThe backups ran as scheduled, no problem.  Then I upgraded to Vista, using a clean install, rather than backing up the old and restoring on the new because I wanted to clean out some stuff that I no longer wanted. Acronis installed just as easily on Vista, no problems.\n\nCouple of things: One, Acronis has more flexibility with scheduling regular tasks than does Ghost, and has more features as well. Second, I have not actually had to use the restore function yet; I have only been backing up my discs but not restoring anything.  So this review is qualified in that sense because I can't tell you if it does what it is supposed to do.

It will completely restore your operating system, programs & files to the time and date that you last saved an image of your drive with Acronis. If you have a software failure, Acronis can have your system up in running in minutes. If you have a hard drive failure, you need to find another similar hard drive and then in minutes you can again have a working system. Acronis 11 performs other tasks but this review only addresses one critical issue: full system image backups.\n\nThe downside of the program is that the menus are not intuitive and can be confusing and at first, a bit frustrating. You absolutely must create & test the Acronis recovery disk to be sure it works and that this recovery disk and your computer will read the hard drive on which you have saved a disk image. You absolutely must validate each disk image you create and then mount it to test that the saved image files are readable. And you must save complete or updated hard drive images frequently, I do it monthly, so you have the data you need is saved in case you need it.\n\nIf your system fails and your saved image is 6 months old, you have lost 6 months of data unless you have saved it on some other restorable media.\n\nIf you do the musts listed above, you can breath easy and be confident that all will be well with your software treasure if you system fails.\n\nLike I began, its a bit complex, you need to take time to understand how the Acronis program works.

{"words": "I purchased this software to have a robust ability to restore my hard drive completely (not just user data) in the case of a drive failure.  This is what the \"image backup\" functionality is for, to allow you to re-create a fully-operational version of your system very quickly in the event of a drive failure.  (As opposed to just a data backup, which still requires you to reinstall the operating system, programs, and all your user settings again from scratch.)\n\nSo, here's my take:\n1) First, any of the positive reviews that have not actually tried to use their backups to restore should really not be given much weight.  If you can backup fine, but can't restore, what's the point?\n2) I am running Windows Vista with a 1 TB drive, and this program worked fine in creating the image backup.\n3) When my drive started throwing off errors, and I replaced it with a new one, I went to my Acronis boot CD to restore from my backup image (on an external drive.)  Part way through the restore wizard, the restore program just froze, for no apparent reason.  And I have been completely unable to restore my system from my backup.\n\nHere is the experience I had with the technical support:\n- You should know that by default, technical support is only available via email with a 48 hr response time.  While this seems reasonable for only paying $40 for a software product, a 48-hour response time makes the product fairly meaningless in the event of a failure, as I can easily restore the operating system and programs from scrtach in less time than this (and just use the free built-in windows backup for a data restore).\n- I went ahead and paid an extra $30 for a single-incident \"premium support\", which is real-time phone support.  However, after 3 separate phone calls, each on hold for 20-30 minutes and NEVER getting a live person (I had to leave a messages), I finally received some email communications which contained solutions that made no impact to my issue.\n- The Tech Support emails provided new \"CD images\" that they wanted me to use instead of my standard boot CD.  (I'm not sure, but I doubt most folks have an extra PC and CD burner sitting around to be abe to do this, when their main PC is dead.)\n- Then I received an email asking me to reformat a flash drive, plug it into my dead computer, and write a batch script that would execute numerous lines of Linux command line codes.  Ok, I'm a pretty technical guy, but I'm not familiar with Linux.  And if the solution to a restore problem requires \"normal everyday users\" who are buying this product for easy home backup/restore to program in Linux, I would suggest this product is not the right fit for most folks.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "I have been a long-time (and very frustrated) Roxio user who, after crash # 953, finally got fed up and decided to try the trial version of Sony Vegas Pro 8.\n\nVegas Pro 8, of course, is a much higher-end product than Roxio Easy Media Creator (version 8 referred to herein for comparative purposes), but here are some reasons why you may wish to reconsider:\n\n1.  First and foremost, if you're serious about video editing and wish to explore new and creative ways to create DVD's, this one is a must.  Roxio will continue to place annoying limitations like 60 second menus.\n\n2.  The controls are far more intuitive.  Creating a slow-motion shot in Vegas Pro 8 is as simple as ctrl+clicking and dragging a video clip to the desired length.  Roxio is a frustrating experience of playing with film speeds until the shoe fits.\n\n3.  Playback while editing is no longer a processing problem with Vegas 8.  Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 (on a Pentium 4 2.6 GHZ Hyper-thread, 1 GB of RAM, and a 256 MB Nvidia GeForce 7800 card) has an annoying tendency to choke and run home to mommy when another process happens to run at the same time.  Vegas Pro 8 takes it all in stride.\n\n4.  RENDERING.  OH, YES, RENDERING.  Roxio seems to think that everything needs to be re-rendered even if the edited video was already an MPEG-2 to start with.  VEGAS PRO 8 DOES NOT DO THIS - if it's already in the right format, it won't ruin the quality by recompressing.\n\n5.  RENDER QUALITY.  Roxio offers constant bit rate encoding.  Period.  Vegas Pro 8 offers 2-pass variable bitrate encoding which allows longer videos to be placed on a DVD, while compressing it at a variable rate so that segments requiring higher quality get what they deserve and segments that are relatively static (i.e., pictures) can be compressed at a much lower rate.  Also, a 9 MBPS video encode from Vegas Pro 8 looks better than a 9 MBPS from Roxio.\n\n6.  Capturing.  Vegas will tell me if my mini DV tape had dropped frames (and so far it has not happened at all); Roxio will not (and it HAS).  I'll make a DVD with Roxio and...surprise!!  I need to recapture that portion of the video because it's shot!!\n\n7.  Bugs.  Roxio is buggy...VERY buggy.  Every time I try to make additional copies of a disc image that I put on my hard drive (because I don't want to live through another Roxio video encode), approximately 25-30 error messages (no, I'm not joking) will pop up that I have to repeatedly close out of before I can use the burn utility.  Not to mention that the initial install of Roxio caused my computer to forget that I had a CD-ROM or a DVD drive.  I had to edit my registry keys so that I could \"find them\" again.  Vegas Pro 8 has had ZERO issues with me.\n\nThere's more, but why go further?  If you're serious about video editing and production, don't settle for less.  This program will do it all from video editing, importing, capturing, image effects, DVD creation (including menus), and Dolby Digital AC-3 encoding (INCLUDING 5.1!!).  I have only scratched the surface of its full potential--there are plenty of tools to explore in there that can allow you to create very professional looking DVD's.\n\nBuy and enjoy!!!!

{"words": "Chances are in your house you have several computers, maybe a laptop or two and a desktop in the den or the your kids room.  All these machines serve different functions -- one is for your business, one might be for storing digital pictures and the kids may use theirs for playing games.  They are all different and even though they reside under the same roof it is next to impossible to share files with them all and when it comes to backup -- well, just ask yourself this, when is the last time you backed any of them up?  You are a digital home but a connected home you are not.\n\nEnter Microsoft's newest product, Windows Home Server.  A revolutionary product that offers consumers centralized storage and backups in their households with a product that you plug in and literally let it run without any intervention on your part.\n\nWindows Home Server makes the concept of a connected home a reality in a simple, easy to use package that will bring your entire digital family together in one place.  Imagine never having to worry about backups again because they are taken automatically, every night, while you sleep.  Think of how easy it would be to share digital pictures, movies and files with your family without having to e-mail them or put them on USB fobs that always seem to get lost.  What if you could check to make sure your kids have their anti-virus protection running without having to check their computer manually?  How about never having to worry about your precious family photos, home videos and important documents getting lost because of a computer crash thanks to data redundancy?\n\nIf these sound like your idea of a dream, then dream no more.  All these features and more await you in Windows Home Server.\n\nThe idea is simple.  Put a machine (doesn't have to be too powerful) in an out of the way location in the house.  It doesn't need a keyboard or a mouse, just hard drives.  But wait, even the hard drives don't have to be all the same or fit inside the box.  You can hook up any combination of hard disks you want -- from internal to external USB and firewire drives.  Windows Home Server manages them for you, creating one big pool of disk space that is duplicated across the drives -- so if one fails, you don't lose one byte of data!\n\nBackups are a breeze as well; every night Windows Home Server backups up files from all the connected PC's and stores them on the server.  However, it doesn't just back up files -- it intelligently decides which files are different, and which aren't and doesn't backup duplicates.  So if everyone in your house has Microsoft Word installed, it won't create 5 backup copies of it.  Just one copy which all 5 computers can restore from!\n\nTraveling and need access to your Powerpoint presentation or important document?  Fire up a web browser and securely access any file stored on the server!  Better yet, remote connect to any computer in your household running Windows Vista or XP and use it as if you were sitting right in front of it.  All from a secure web browser!\n\nOne more thing for all you XBOX 360 owners out there, or those of you who have digital picture frames that are network-aware -- Windows Home Server has the ability to stream content to your XBOX 360 and to your digital picture frames!  Functionality \"out of the box\", which will no doubt be extended further as third party applications start to appear thanks to the Windows Home Server Software Development Kit (SDK) that Microsoft has released for WHS.\n\nIn Windows Home Server Microsoft has created a product (based off of Windows 2003 Server) that any household can use and enjoy without having to worrying about \"IT Support\".  The product just simply works, and needs almost zero maintenance.

{"words": "Overview\n\nThis is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.\n\nUnpacking\n\nThe array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.\n\nInstallation\n\nYou will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.\n\nHardware\n\nAll hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.\n\nThe array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.\n\nOne HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.\n\nI did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.\n\nA nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.\n\nDuring my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I have a cheap gas stove and I always wanted one of those expensive versions. (You know the one's on everyone's TV kitchen) ... This griddle cooks pancakes, french toast, cheese sandwiches and eggs on the smooth side wonderfully. Just kick the burners on high, let it warm up, knock them back to medium until its hot evenly and throw the food on. Don't worry about heating an empty pan, Cast iron can take it. When a water droplet bounces and its not smoking its ready. (Smoking is too hot, duh!)\n The other great use is to put it in the oven, turn the broiler/oven on and let it heat up. Then toss on the steaks, ribs, or fish! Yum!\nThe Lodge seasoning is ok for that first time cooking. You do need to wash off the manufacturing dirt, and a good coat of oil is a good way to start that carbon buildup.\nOn the down side, the burner grates on my stove instersect with the indented handle slots. There is a slight lip on the pan so that it rests directly on the grate. If you slide the pan down just slightly and to the center of the stove, it sets in just right. But I could see that on not all stoves it would fit as well. The alternative would be to get two of the open cast iron rings that fit on the stove grates and put the griddle on top of them. (These rings are normally designed to aid in holding a small pot over a larger more open gas stove grate) (I got two cast iron grates from the hardware store. I think they were \"storm\" grates. In an outside fire I burnt the paint off them and now they work fine holding the griddle up off the stove. Also Lodge has a 8\" castiron trivet which looks like it should work as well.)\nIt is heavy, yup. It doesn't fit in my sink very well, but then if you've ever watched the guy at the bar & grill clean his grill, he does it right on the stove. So while the giddle is hot, give it a good scrape with the spatula, and wipe it with a paper towel. You'll get 90% of the food/grease off the pan. Then a quick rinse when it cools down gets the rest. (In the sink put a large sponge under the edge and one behind it to avoid scratching things.)\nAlso if you cook bacon, or other high fat food, it splatters. Since the lip is low, it doesn't catch the grease spatters the way a good fry pan does. More stove cleanup...While it grills ok on the stove top, It's not a replacement for the charcoal cooker. You will need a good vent hood to catch the smoke. (Well yeah)\nAlso if you plan on using it inside your oven, measure first! Not all ovens are 20\" wide inside.\n(I have much older cast iron fry pans and everything that's been said about them becoming smooth and non stick is true. Took about 5 years of off and on cooking to do it, and 10 to become perfect. Grandma's pans went to my mother so I had to season my own pans myself. This pan because of the dual sided cooking only took about a month to equal that old fry pan.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I bought this awhile ago but after nearly ruining the finish on my electric stove, I started using it in the oven for hamburgers.  The coils on the stove did not lift the grill up high enough and heat was trapped underneath which damaged the finish.  I finally retired it to the top of the stove to await the longed for day of owning a gas range.\n\nThat day finally arrived two years later after moving to a new home!  This grill was meant for the open flame of a gas range.  Keeping in mind the mess/damage created when cooking with the grill or oversize pots on the electric stove, I purchased a Kenmore Elite Duel Fuel range that has a really nice recessed range top that helps keep your hot cookware away from the finish.\n\nI used the grill for the first time on the new stove to make the Chicken Paillards from Stephen Raichlen's Indoor! Grilling cookbook.  The grill heated quickly, and the heat was evenly distributed so I wasn't limited to just cooking in one area like before because the smaller element on the electric stove didn't get the grill hot enough.\n\nEven though I wasn't using it that often on the other stove, I kept it seasoned so I didn't have any problems with sticking.  So far in addition to the chicken, I have cooked scrambled eggs, hash browns, and French toast without anything sticking.\n\nI still keep the grill on top of the stove, and I use it daily to toast bagels lightly spritzed with olive oil.  Both sides of the grill are seasoned and neither seem to be affected by direct exposure to the flames.\n\nAs with any cast iron cookware, clean up is a breeze if the cookware is seasoned properly.\n\n8/12/06\nI have since started using this on top of the grill grate of my Weber Kettle for grilling fish.  Since nothing else seemed to prevent fish from sticking, no matter how clean, hot, or how well oiled the grate.  I decided to try this on the grill since fish doesn't stick to it when I cook with it on top of the stove.  I grilled a whole salmon fillet(with skin) on it and scooped the whole thing off with my fish spatula with no sticking!  For easier clean up, I scraped the remaining oil and particles into the side channels so they wouldn't burn into the grill.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I own at least a dozen of the lodge cookware pieces and love them very much but this is not such a great thing. I went through the normal in the oven seasoning that always works just great but this thing warped like a potato chip! It did flatten back out as it cooled but everytime I put it on my two burners to use, it warps again making it very rocky on the stove top and my pancakes looked like Picasso made them. It always flattens back out but it's really a pain in the ah hum to use. The grill side set off all the smoke detectors and left a greasey film on everything in my whole house and I was only using a med low burner, well, at least the door stopped squeeking! It is also a bit to narrow for two rows of pancakes unless you make them very small and the center doesn't get hot enough. Just when you thought you've experienced all the unpleasantness of this pan, you then go to clean it and discover you'd be better off just throwing it out in the yard for the dogs to lick clean! I love you Lodge, I really do but I'll stick to outside grilling and my larger lodge skillet for hotcakes, the 13 inch round pan is a dream as are all the other pieces I own.

It comes with a 12\" sleeve that gets cemented in the ground and the pole then slides in/out for use or storage.  We dug a hole 12\" deep by 9\" wide in the back yard.  After taping off the bottom of the sleeve we placed the bottom half of the two-piece pole into the sleeve and centered it in the hole.  We used string, tent stakes and a level to make sure the pole was plumb, then mixed the concrete and poured.  After setting for a couple of days it was ready to go.  We just pumped up the ball, tied it to the eyelet at the top of the upper pole and connected the two poles.  We did find that the ball was hanging low so we adjusted the tie-off.\n\nThe kids love playing and it is a lot of fun.  One minor drawback is that the two-piece pole does 'wobble' a bit between the two sections and within the sleeve.  But it's not that noticeable and does not detract from the fun.

The bars are comprise of a heavy-duty steel type of material that holds up well to both abuse from play and the outdoor elements.

The frame is black, powder-coated steel that is solid and durable and fits securely together with 8 screws with wingnuts (2 in each corner) that hold it tightly in place.  It stands upright with no leaning or wobbling.  This is a higher quality than previous Franklin goals I have used.  It is an improvement for sure.  It assembles in about 10 minutes.  The only weakness is the set of velcro straps that secure the very good net to the frame.  These will fail over time, and I suggest buying some zip ties for a lasting means to connect the net to the frame.  It comes with six steel u-shaped stakes that hold the goal structure firmly in place.  These are needed with kids 10+ years old.  I think this is an excellent backyard or schoolyard goal and can be used with small sided games for youths.\n\nFor the 6 x 4 goal...This goal can work as a competition goal for kids about 8 and under who play small sided games. For kids that age and younger, this frame can take their best shots. Probably when kids get to about 9+ years old, they will start knocking it around even with the stakes. For all ages, this is a suitable goal for small goal games on a soccer field or in the backyard. The goal is pretty solid and sturdy. The stakes are helpful and the netting is good.

There's lots of comments in the Amazon reviews about how this thing may or may not stand up to weather.  The truth is that, over time, *nothing* is going to stand up to ultraviolet rays or water (the universal solvent). If you want this goal to last longer, just get a large tarp to put over it (we got one from Harbor Freight).

The frame appears sturdy enough even for my wild child.  The entire goal is relatively large (for a kid) but it's not heavy if you need to move it.  Overall, seems like a very good purchase.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Easy to assembly.  The quality is fine with the price.  The design could be better.  I am thinking about getting a few sand bags to secure the goal against strong wind.  The pins for securing the net to the ground are very thin.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Really nice size frame for little soccer players.  At 6x4, it's pretty portable and relatively lightweight.  That said, when I caught my 6yo and her cousin hanging from the top bar like a pair of monkeys, it still took that 90-ish pounds of weight without bending or bowing at all.  The poles lock together with clip pins, ensuring it stays securely together through play and them pops apart quickly for travel or storage.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Overall this is a nice soccer goal, and perfect for smaller yards.  The goal comes in pieces, with the metal poles requiring assembly into each other to make the goal itself.  This was fairly straightforward, and the goal seems strong and well built once I set it up.  My only complaint is that the net isn't really designed to go onto the goal.  It comes with little velcro straps that you have to use to attach the net to the goal.  I would have preferred if the net threaded onto the goal, or if the net itself had velcro or some other feature to allow a more seamless attachment to the poles.  This would have made a better overall design.  But for a simple goal that is relatively easy to setup, this is a nice option.", "label": "good review"}

The frame is fairly strong and is definitely strong enough to hold the net. Though it is easy to set up and take apart, it does take some time. It's not a quick up and down set up. The net is not as strong as I would like it to be and it seems a bit tighter on the frame than the picture shows and doesn't fit as well. If you have a really strong kicker the net may not last long. Other than that, it's a good practice net for the backyard.", "label": "good review"}

The pictures offer a pretty fair representation of what you're getting, and I have no issues highly recommending this one.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Though not designed to be a \"portable\" goal, this small goal breaks down and sets up pretty easily, and it isn't too bulky to transport to and from practice venues.  The instructions are limited, but the set up is relatively intuitive, and a person can set it up solo in less than half an hour.  The frame is sturdy and the net, though lightweight, has held up to everything our 8- and 6yos have kicked at it.  This goal is the \"right size\" for small kids to shoot at and defend in games, and is a convenient size to set up for practicing targeted shots at home for older kids.\n\nPlease note! Franklin makes several sizes, so be sure you're getting something appropriate for the age of the player(s).  Here's a guide for youth soccer goal sizes:\n8x24 (U14-Adult)\n6x18 (U12)\n6x18 or smaller (U8-U10)\n6.5x12 (Indoor)\n4x6 (U6,3v3)", "label": "good review"}

I've been using it about every day and haven't moved it from the back yard, which is saying a lot living in Florida where the sun is absolutely pounding on it...as well as lots of rain.\n\nAssembling the goal was easy enough as were the directions. I wasn't looking forward to putting it together but it was done before I knew it. I am disappointed with the Velcros and the amount that they supplied. I wish they were a little more heavy duty, as I am not the strongest kicker and they fall off sometimes. I will have to pick up a pack of heavy duty ones later.\n\nI can use the net without having fears of it moving around which is great. This is such an awesome net to practice accuracy shots and to have little 1 on 1 games with friends.\n\nI am going to keep the net longer outside and will update the review if anything changes regarding the net.", "label": "good review"}

The goal is a good practice size for toddlers to younger kids (7-9).", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This goal was easy to set up. My wife and I put it together but it can easily be done with one person. Attaching the net probably took the most time.

So I wasn't sure what\nI would get with the 6X4 soccer net and the fact that the net attaches\nusing Velcro straps. The package was double boxed and each powder coated\nsteel pipe was individually wrapped in plastic. That was very nice to\nsee. There were plenty of Velcro ties for a 6X4 net as well. Putting the\nnet together was a piece of cake. The 6 pipes were numbered and using\nlocking pins was easy and provided much strength. The net was marked\nwith flags that indicated the top and bottom corners. That was also a\nhuge time saver.\n\nOnce assembled the net is sturdy for small children without the metal\nstakes. Using the stakes, the net is perfect for older kids. The net is\nlight enough to move around the yard, but heavy enough to be sturdy.\nVery happy with this net so far.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This is a ouster size for my 10 and 7 year old boys and their friends. It is easy to put together until you get to the net. The red tabs go on the top but you have to use loose velcro straps to connect it. I'm not a fan of this method. I'd have preferred the velcro be on the net so we know where to put them or to use hooks like other Franklin Sports products. But once it's together it's good.

It contains stakes that keep the net from tipping over, but the poles are heavy enough that it will stay in place under most circumstances. The net is attached with Velcro strips which makes assemble easy, but durability in the weather could be questionable. It comes nicely packed in plastic and can be assembled by one person.

It would have been nice to have a Pitchers rubber too, but it isn't like you can push off any non stationary base anyway. Still, it would be nice to have a reference point for the pitcher.\n\nWhile these bases would work with metal spikes, I don't know how long they would last.

Its position means you can only turn the screw a half turn at a time with a standard Allen key.  A long T-handle Allen key solves that problem, but not its other fault, difficulty removing the motor from the base.  That same Allen key must be loosened several turns and then the block that acts as a wedge has to be loosened by tapping on it.

{"words": "Huh. So I had a love-hate relationship with sanders. My first sander was actually a Bosch finishing sander. I used it to refinish a table once, and spent half four hours trying to get rid of swirl marks, then had a tingling sensation in my wrist for the next day. I eventually went with a nice 5\" Makita random orbit sander, but it wasn't any gentler on my wrists, and on top of that, with round pads, it was basically useless for corners or any even moderately complicated shapes.\n\nFinally, when I had a larger project that required more substantial sanding, I bought a 6 amp 6\" random orbit sander from Bosch. Sure, it worked faster - but was heavy, unwieldy, *extremely* noisy - and I still hated using it for more than 5 minutes or so.\n\nSo, I changed my ways. I bought this sander for finishing work, and let me tell you: it's awesome. It's ergonomic and almost completely vibration-free. It's pretty quiet... and it still packs quite a punch. It takes cheap sheet paper, too, so you're not bleeding money as quickly as you would with sanding discs. The only caveats to keep in mind is that it doesn't come with dust extraction; and in part because of no forced airflow, it gets warm after a while.\n\nAs for serious sanding - say, when stripping finishes or surfacing rough lumber - I just went with a handheld 3 x 21\" belt sander; it's a beast, but it's fast, quiet, and gentle on my joints. I suspect that a belt + sheet sander combo makes much more sense than trying to use a random orbit sander for everything - and getting RSI.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "One of the best block sanders ever designed. Be aware that this design dates back to the 1960's, when Porter Cable had been owned by Rockwell International. I am happy to see it back in production after a few years hiatus. 2nd only to the 1/2 sheet PC model 505 for \"best\" block sander ever made.\n\nThe 330 and 505 Sanders have been THE best block sanders available since the 1960's with no serious competition for decades.\n\nRemaining relevant and setting trends after decades:\nIn the 1980's Porter Cable updated both the 330 speedblock, and 505 with the then innovative \"StickIt\" sandpaper system. Using self adhesive rolls that fit both sanders, and a dispenser system, there was no longer a need for using the clamps on the sander to adhere paper, making paper changes a matter of seconds.\nThis innovation was HUGE, and was carried over to the new \"Random Orbit\" sanders in the form of self adhesive disks. The self adhesive sandpaper took the market by storm, other manufacturers had to follow to compete. The now common Velcro backed papers/systems soon followed. to date, the self adhesive standard width rolls remain the most cost effective quick change sandpaper system available.\n\nAt this point in time I own 6 of these sanders and another 5 of the larger 1/2 sheet 505 models. The oldest date back to the 1960's models, the most recent being the two new 330 I received today.\nI hope that the new manufacturing plant does them justice!", "label": "good review"}

The bulk/weight of the unit can be counter productive in smooth movements in this regard given the small surface area of the edge guide, but since it comes with holes already I think you're not supposed to use it as is to begin with. Though after attaching a straight piece to the black edge guide I discovered that the edge guide while stiff laterally can be easily bent vertically.

What's even more hilarious are many of the 1 and 2 star reviews which complain that the Elf on the Shelf is creepy and a poor way to teach your children about morality and good behavior. So let's get this straight...\nYou LIE to your children year after year telling them that there is a Santa Claus that flies around the world in a magical sleigh pulled by magical reindeer and delivers toys to children all over the world in one night and, of course, \"he sees you when you're sleeping, he sees you when you're awake and knows if you've been bad or good\"...but the Elf on the Shelf is creepy and a poor way to teach good behavior? The concept of Santa Claus, himself, is pretty creepy too when you think about. Oddly, you manage to find a way to make it not creepy. And if you're really bothered by the using the Elf as an external motivator to teach morals, maybe you should start teaching morals by simply not LYING to your children in the fist place! But--then what are you left with? You'd have to explain Christmas being about Jesus Christ and why He came into the world and all the stuff of sin and death and love and sacrifice and all that Christianity. So if you don't believe that and/or aren't ready to go there with it, you've stuck yourself with Santa Claus and his elves.\nThe Elf on the Shelf is a cute idea that can be made fun and humorous and doesn't need to seem like Santa just planted a Gestapo agent in the house.\nGet off the high horse and lighten up a bit. It's Christmas! Just have fun with the magic of imagination! In the end, it's just an elf doll. Make it what you want it to be!

With their Elf partners help, they stayed on the nice list and Santa finally came to see them with lots of goodies and toys! The elf was very nicely made, the packaging was cute also. The story was cute and the kids loved it. I should also note that even the scheptical 7 year old believed it.

{"words": "This creature possesses dark magic. I thought I was going to have to move him around like other people say they do but I didn't. He was always in a different place in the morning. At first the things \"Jingle\" did were pretty cute; making the toilet paper into a snow man, writing notes to my child in cute backwards handwriting...but then things started to get strange. The first morning that I became concerned was when I found him in my daughters bathroom in front of the mirror that had writing on it. I expected it to say something cute like \"It's almost Christmas\" or \"Happy Holidays!\" but what I found was \"REDRUM\". Being horror movie fans, I just chalked it up to him trying to mess with my husband and I and told my daughter that he was just being silly. But then the next morning, I found something VERY disturbing. Jingle was sitting in my daughters floor with one of her barbies in A NOOSE. After this occurred I told my daughter I thought it was time to send Jingle back to the North Pole and ask Santa for a new elf. She was confused but said okay. So I took the elf and tossed him in the dumpster at our apartments and went to Target to purchase a new one. Due to being freaked out over the elf I had received I purchased a girl one this time. That night I showed my child her new Elf on a Shelf and she named her \"Lulu Bell\". That evening I placed Lulu Bell in the Christmas tree and the next morning she was still there! I was elated that I had finally gotten a normal elf and that Jingle was gone. I went to bed that next night after putting Lulu Bell on the couch with a book on her lap and the next morning I woke up to my daughter screaming. I ran into the living room to find Lulu Bell on the floor with what I assumed was ketchup on her neck and there beside her was Jingle, with a butter knife in his hand and \"ketchup\" on it as well. I quickly called Amazon and informed them of the situation and then I found out, they had never sent me an elf because the one I wanted was on back order....\n\n(This was a fictional story for the amusement of myself and others. My true review is that my daughter loved her elf and we had a lot of fun with it!)", "label": "good review"}

So much fun all throughout December, and to be able to see the wonder and joy in your child's eyes every  morning when they wake up to see the elf in a new spot is irreplaceable.

{"words": "George the Elf arrived promptly at the end of November. The book that he brought with him helped our daughter (almost 3 years old) get acquainted with Santa's intelligence operative. After arriving on the first night, George began his mission to spy on our daughter and ensure the big Jolly guy had the information he needed to determine if our daughter was naughty or nice...\n\nEvery night, he left our location to quickly relay info the Santa and the Claus Intelligence Agency. Each morning, much to the surprise of our daughter, he would be found somewhere conversing with her toys (and closest confidants) or, most commonly, creating a little mischief. I personally believe this was a way of testing our daughter to see which side of the list she would be on. Luckily, our daughter seemed to have passed these tests with flying colors, because it appears that George called in for air cover on Christmas Eve, judging by the gifts that Santa brought.\n\nOverall, we were a little worried that our daughter was not quite ready for her very own operative, but we were pleasantly surprised at how much she talked about George. We'll welcome George back into our home next year, but I'm going to need to have a little conversation with him about the toothpaste on the bathroom mirror...", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Our three year old twins are getting old enough where they are starting to understand certain concepts so we thought this Christmas would be the perfect year to purchase an Elf on the Shelf. They loved it and had so much fun with it! I believe Elf on the Shelf is a relatively new tradition but I love the look of the scout elf because he has the look of a 1950s figurine. Included in the very sturdy and reusable box is the elf and a colorful, hardcover storybook which explains in a rhyming, storytelling manner how to use the Elf on the Shelf. The elf itself is approximately 13 inches tall, fully-extended, and his outfit feels like it is made of a felt-like material. His body is stuffed with plastic pellets and his head is made of hard plastic with nicely painted-on facial features. He doesn't sit very well by himself but there are plenty of ways to prop him up. His hands are also stitched together which makes it fun to dangle him from a doorknob, chandelier, or any other fun spot you can think of!\n\nThe storybook is a beautiful hardcover with colorful pictures and the book reads like a rhyme. It is approximately 26 pages long and explains how the Elf on the Shelf works. The idea behind it is the scout elf is sent to your family each year and will keep an eye on the children on behalf of Santa. You get to name the elf and he will continue to be your family's scout elf. At night, the elf will fly to the North Pole to report good and/or naughty behavior, then fly back to the family where he will get into something during the night and the children will wake up the next morning, excited to find him! The elf is always watching and the only rule is that the elf can't be touched otherwise the magic will disappear. When the elf flies back to the North Pole on Christmas Eve, he won't return to your family until the next Christmas season.\n\nI really love this activity for my kids and felt that, at almost three years old, it was the perfect age to introduce this to them! My kids always got so excited to look for our elf in the morning and kept asking throughout the day why he was trying to get out the door or why he was hanging from the Christmas tree. I was also very impressed with how well my kids listened to the rule and they never touched him. Whenever they started acting up, I would tell them our elf is watching and we don't want him to have to report any naughty behavior to Santa. It didn't always work but hey, I tried. Overall, I think this is a great activity for families and I felt it was very reasonably priced for the amount of fun we had. I highly recommend this to give your kids something to look forward to every morning during the Christmas season!", "label": "good review"}

On a few occasions, our daughter swore he moved when we were not home and even left it a picture and notes. It is nice to see her wake up happy and ready to find the little rascal.\n\nThe elf itself consists of a typical stuffing material and is pretty bendable and strong. We have had him bend-hung-flattened and he is like new with no signs of any issues. The box it comes with is very solid and makes for a great sturdy storage for in between seasons.\n\nGreat idea that once you buy it, will provide years of enjoyment. Highly recommend. Might even be adding the girl version in the future.\n\nI took one star away as the hands lacked an important feature. They come stitched together which limit the function for positions, etc a great deal. They should put strong magnets in the hands so that you can separate them and use them for metal object ideas, etc.", "label": "good review"}

Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later.\n\nTwisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically...\n\nTwisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral.\n\nTwisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1.\n\nTwisted Metal Black: First Playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name Incognito entertainment.  Best Graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games.  With nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now)  this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series.\n\nTwisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "The other night one of my friends picked up the new Twisted Metal game for the PS3. After playing for a few minutes, a wave of memories came flooding back into my mind of the original vehicular combat game (well, besides Carmageddon), so I had to dust it off and throw it in the other day. To my surprise, I played for a couple of hours and found myself still enjoying it.\n\nIt looks awful. The controls are pretty unresponsive. The computer is unforgiving and the other cars are almost always at an advantage. So you must be wondering, why exactly did I enjoy this game? Maybe it was the nostalgia factor, but I think it was more of the fact that the game is so simplistic that you can jump right into it and play it without having to sacrifice a ton of time to do so. I beat the game in under an hour; there are only 6 levels to play through, each one amping up the difficulty. Players are not really rewarded for progressing through the game over multiple playthroughs. It is this lack of replayability that factors into my rating of the game.\n\nThe characters are memorable. There are 12 in total, each one coming with a ridiculous backstory.  Just about every one of these characters is balanced, offering enough of a challenge to make you think through your actions. Will you select Mr. Grimm, with his ultra powerful weapons, or sacrifice speed for a bruiser that can take a lot of damage, such as the monster truck? The bottom line is that there is something here for everyone.\n\nThe violence is so over the top that it's comical, rather than graphic. I won't focus on the story, because there isn't much of one. The game centers around an annual competition, in which the last \"man\" standing is granted a wish that he can use to get anything desired. I think it goes without saying that you're not picking this game up for the story line. At the end of the day, the game feels dated. Passwords take the place of save features, and the game has an arcade feel to it. The soundtrack is just good enough where it doesn't get annoying, but it is repetitive and far from memorable, having a heavy metal feel to it. In the end, don't expect to be overwhelmed by the games presentation. However, that does not mean that you shouldn't play this game if you haven't already done so. Any fan of video games or the Twisted Metal series can still appreciate this classic.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "I have played this through several times because the puzzles are excellent and you kill zombies.  There are many puzzles I still haven't solved and I may end up playing though again just to see whats there.  Also, some of the graphics were nice and I love the fear, even though I played RE's 2&3 first, this one scared me the most (but being the first I played, only RE2 gave me nightmares for months).  I will agree, this game is hard core, and there is plenty to like about it.  I love interactive movie feeling like Final Fantasy VII and Wing Commander: Prophecy.\nHowever, now I will list what I didn't like.  Why I only gave it three stars.  Well, to start off, the cinematics are not only outdated, but horribly done to begin with.  If I made the game, I would have just said: \"Y'know, that was really bad, let's just not have a cinematic.\"  Also, the movement is quite shabby and fake looking, and while a zombie hovers into a standing position, you can't shoot him until he is standing up and walking toward you.\nIf you think that such a picky thing about positioning, picking up items is worse.  You can commonly at a position in which you appear to be facing an item perfectly, but you can't pick it up, because it's really 30 degrees to your left or something like that.  With these positions, you are forced to listen to mind-numbing music.  I thought the sound effects were bad and the voice acting made the sound bad enough, but they had to go and give us the abolute worst soundtrack you will ever find, for any game or B-Movie.  The only trouble with the music is that you require listening to the sound effects to survive, and so you must endure the music as well!\nHowever, the music is beaten in abysmal-ness by its dialogue.  The script is terrible, and to say the voice acting is laughably bad would be a huge understatement.  It doesn't end there.  The pitiful dialogue scenes do nothing but tell one of the most cliche-ridden plots ever devised.  You have police traitors, huge creatures that come out of rooms that you just came out of to kill you, and worst of all, you have about three dozen times through the two stories (which are almost identical) where people walk in just in the nick of time to save the other.  That type of stuff makes me sick.  You are alone for about two hours, when suddenly a trap goes off, right as your partner happens to be right outside.\nLets rate everything: Images: 8,  Movement: 5,  Script: 1.5,  Sound Effects: 6,  Background Story: 5,  Music: 0.5,  Voice Acting: 0,  Puzzles: 10+,  Mosters: 5/6,  Weapons: 8,  Fear: 9.5,  Plot/Sequence of Events: -2.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "The original Resident Evil changed the game industry forever. Although the Survival Horror genre is certainly old, being Interplay's \"Alone in the Dark\" the first example to come to my mind, RE sent the genre and the video game industry where it had never before ventured.\n  The idea, simple as it sounds, harbors with it the strength to create a fine video game experience: Lock yourself at a mansion filled with zombies and other creatures plus limited ammo, and try to get yourself out of this.\n  This is the only game of the series that is worth of any praise, not only because it did much for the industry, but because of its game play value.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Nowadays, blowing zombies up is as commonplace as a 2D fighter that houses a character that can throw a fireball. From the \"House Of The Dead\" series to \"Silent Hill\", everyone has ripped off  Capcom's masterpiece. The story starts off in a city us hardcore gamers  will all know, Raccoon City. On a hill in an out-of-the-way area lies a  mansion that holds a deadly secret. Down in Raccoon City, the community has  had violent attacks by zombies that are bumpig off the townspeople. The  R.P.D. send out their S.T.A.R.S. unit to find out what's up with this  mansion and it's 'monsters'. Both the Alpha and Omega teams shall never be  the same....... What you encounter through this tale of death is nothing  short of terror perfetion. From your first encounter with dogs, to your  first boss, to your return to the mansion only to find your zombie pals  have been replaced with gremlins from hell called hunters; this is  horror-gaming nirvana. Your characters are Jill Valentine and Chris  Redfield. You get to pick which character you lead (or lead you) down your  path of hell. Jill is the easier one to use, while Chris is the harder one.  For example, Jill starts off with a pistol, while Chris starts off with the  forever dreaded knife. Basically their stories are the same with some  different twists thrown in here and there. For example, Jill's sidekick is  Barry, while Chris gets Rebecca. Throughout your journey, you pick up on  clues as to what's going on. Such as diary entries. You come across the  mansion twice, a backhouse, a garden, an underground passage way, and an  underground laboratory throughout your story. All the while you hear the  name of a corporation (one that will haunt you throughout the series) known  as Umbrella. The game isn't hard, but it isn't easy either. Worrying about  ammo and herbs is always the number one priority. Playing through the game  to see what's ahead (you know, horse around), then go out for real and work  your way through the story is the biggest tip I can give. And always save  (just don't over do the ink ribbons, there's only so many). The graphics  were breathtaking then and still hold up today. The control is difficult  for some to get used to, but I never had a problem with it. The sound is  also amazing, but quite important. Usually when I play games, I put on my  headphones (Nine Inch Nails for me) and play away. Unfortunately, I can't  do this. You need the sound to hear what's going on, whether it's zombies  that are lurking around a corner you can't see, or something following you,  you have to listen. This adds to the gaming element immensely. It'll often  scare you, but that's the point, adding a new gaming dimension. One of  fear. My only problem with the game, is the story of who originally owned  the mansion. ... Ultimately, Capcom scratched all that.  And it detracts from it all as the story behind the mansion has too many  holes. In the end though, this was a classic video game. Not the best  Resident Evil, but mandatory if you intend to play them all as the story is  missing a lot if you pick up on the series when it's already told so much.  It's graphic, it's bloody, it's epic, it's scary and it's an experience you  won't soon forget. Just don't play with the lights off, you'll never sleep  again.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This is the very first twisted metal game to come out and i loved it. It is different than the rest of them but it is still fun to play. It has the original people and tracks to go to so if u have played any of the other twisted metal games u will reconize most of these people. It is very hard to beat because it is the first game and it took a long time to get used to. The graphics well this is the first one, its on the ps1, and it is a very old game so yes they r not very good. It is all blocky and the cars move in weird directions. This is a great game on multiplayer though, there r many different things to do unstead of just battleing each other. After u beat the game a couple of times it is easy to play and beat ur friends at it. This is a very fun but challenging game.", "label": "good review"}

This one had all the perfect levels and the perfect balance of characters set in a darker tone than the other games had besides TM:Black of course. I liked how each level had some destructible environments as well as the inside cockpit view in the cars. The stories for each of the characters were all interesting and made you want to play through with each character.

{"words": "When I first played this game (seven years ago) I instantly got hooked. Twisted Metal was the first of its kind. No one had ever heard of a car game where you drive around blowing your computer opponents away. Even though the gameplay was drawling as you did the same thing for level after level after level, no one cared. That's how great this game was (and still is).

The characters are awesome and the gameplay is phenomenal.\nBottom Line: Twisted Metal rocks!!!!!!!", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "The first day I played this game (about seven years ago), I was shocked in a good way, because this game is phenomenal.  Using vehicles for combat and multiplied destruction couldn't be better.  Even though its graphics could be sharpened and more detailed, the gameplay, and value of this game are in the spotlight.  Each level are unique from each other, and I must say that they include a lot of beautiful textures; they range from an underground arena, to skycrapers.  Using the sophisticated weaponry with advanced techniques will keep you glued to your screen; you get to retrieve weapons you see that appear, and use them for your enemies.  As for sound, the SFX is a little over average, it isn't as detailed or spectacular.  With the music though, that's one concept of this game that makes it outstanding; orchestra, symphony type music with a touch of hard core music makes this game prosperous.\nYou can play 2-player deathmatches which really kick arse.  If you're alone and want to do a tournament match, you will fight and may win until you ask Calypso, the leader in the car combat series, for your ultimate wish to come true.\nIf you are someone who likes to battle the brawl on the urban side of town, then this game is for you.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I din't get this game until almost a year ago, but I still find it to be pretty fun. It has a tiny roster (with only ten guys) that is EXTREMELY outdated, but I recognized most of the guys, several of them being among my favorite wrestlers. (The only one who was completely unfamiliar to me was Ahmed Johnson.) I think the graphics are really good although the wrestlers aren't very large on the screen, and the gameplay is done pretty well. No, the game isn't very realistic, but I think that just adds to the fun! Some people seem to have issues with the load times, but I don't really think the load times are bad at all. I've played games that have much longer load times! I think this game is much better than WCW Vs. The World (which is one of the only two other wrestling games I have for PS1), even though that game has many more guys on it!", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "WWF In Your House, while graphically WORSE than WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, should *not* be ignored if you like that Wrestlemania game because In Your House features the *exact* same arcade wrestling action.  The wrestlers have been updated too.\n\nYes, WWF In Your House is an old game with noticeably average graphics and not-so smooth animations.  It came out in 1996, I believe.  The graphics simply aren't as good as Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  BUT if you're a fan of Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, I see no reason why you wouldn't like In Your House.\n\nSome reviewers claim this game is hard.  It's really not that hard once you remember the most effective and damaging moves. It's easier than Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  In fact, if you consider yourself a fast gamer, you won't have ANY trouble with In Your House.  There's an option to put the game on easy, so if you must, put the game on easy.  Also turning blocking off helps make the game much easier.  Using the run button that's located at the top of the Playstation controller (I believe it's either L2 or R2, or maybe both) is a MUCH better idea than using the OTHER way of running (hitting two buttons at once- ugh!)\n\nThe loading time is somewhat worse than Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, but only somewhat.  In Your House takes maybe 3 or 4 seconds longer to load a match, if that.  Unfortunately, the way Vince McMahon introduces the wrestlers is pretty bland and uninteresting compared to Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game where you actually saw the wrestlers running forward, towards their opponents, featuring their own distinct animations (such as Shawn Michaels posing and Doink \"the clown\" squirting water).  In this game, Vince just SAYS who you're facing while a boring picture appears on screen showing the wrestlers.  It's not as good.\n\nYou get to play as 10 wrestlers, and each wrestler has his own set of unique moves.  It's better to try finishing off your opponent using the moves that drain the most energy.  That's the number one rule to winning.\n\nGoing through a World Title tournament in Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game takes about 10 minutes.  Here it takes about 20 minutes, because you have to compete in more matches.  It's not a problem at all, though.  If anything, it's better this way, because it's *so* much fun going through all the rounds and whipping out one devastating move after another.  Some of these moves are realistic, while other moves are too extreme for wrestlers to be able to perform in reality.  For example, the Ultimate Warrior shooting lightning and the Undertaker shooting some kind of demonic spirits at you.  It doesn't happen in real life.\n\nYou get to play as Shawn Michaels, Vader, Bret Hart, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, The British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith, The Undertaker, Goldust, The Ultimate Warrior, and Hunter Hearst Helmsley.  People may complain that this is a really small list of wrestlers to choose from, but it's actually better than the more updated wrestling games on the market today that feature WAY too many wrestlers that have no reason to exist.  At least with a small selection, you will be able to remember all your opponents main power moves.  Plus, giving you a small list of selectable wrestlers makes it feel more like a short and intense arcade game, which is the point.\n\nIt's probably the hardest going through the tournaments (all three of them) with Goldust because his energy seems to drain very quickly, and it's probably the easiest to complete these tournaments with Shawn Michaels or the British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith because they have MANY power moves that finish your opponent off very quickly.\n\nBut as I said above, this game is worse than Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game because the graphics and animations aren't in the same league.  But see, the thing is, In Your House and Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game are the ONLY arcade wrestling games with the WWE logo on them.  This means we only have TWO games like this that exist in the entire world.  Sure beats having a million slow-moving big and bulky 3D WWE games out there that have no major innovations implemented whatsoever to separate themselves, right?\n\nI have a lot of fun with these arcade style wrestling games, so realism doesn't matter to me at all.  I will take this game over any and all of the best-looking WWE wrestling games that are so popular today.  I prefer wrestling games that are FAST, and that's what In Your House is all about.  It's fast, exciting, unique and with practice, not very difficult to complete.  Who cares about graphics?\n\nSo, in short, I don't CARE that In Your House is sort of a low-budget looking WWE game.  This and Wrestlemania are the only games like it.\n\nAlso, the commentators, Vince McMahon and Mr. Perfect, have a LOT more things to say in In Your House compared to Vince and Jerry Lawler in Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  Also worth mentioning: each wrestler has their own special thing to say at the beginning and end of a match.  Okay, so they don't say things ALL the time, but many times they do.\n\nBoth the Playstation and Saturn versions are great.  The Playstation version has shorter loading times, and plus I think the Playstation controller is better for delivering moves because of the simple button layout.  Also, there's a Sound Test option only in the Playstation version where you can hear all the sound effects and theme songs in the game.  I mean EVERY SINGLE THING you hear in the game can be found in the sound menu!  It's pretty awesome.\n\nThe Saturn version has a couple things that the Playstation version doesn't have, so don't worry Saturn fans!  Exclusive to the Saturn version includes an extra move for the Undertaker (in this version, you can deliver multiple chokeslams to your opponent - you can't do this on the Playstation version) and plus the Saturn version was created so you can perform finishing moves whenever you want, whereas in the Playstation version they can only be delivered during one-on-one matches.  It doesn't matter how many people you are facing on the Saturn version, you can deliver finishing moves at the end of every match, if you'd like.\n\nEither version is great though.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I don't get why so many people rate this a high game. There's nothing special about it at all. I got this game awhile back and thought it was pretty lame so the game went into retirement, until I decided to pull it out for the first time in many many years and play it and my thoughts remain the same.\n\nFor WCW's first video game made during the Monday Night Wars, this was pretty terrible. For starters, this is more of an arcade type of video game then a game you'd expect. The game came out in 1997, yet looks and feels like it was made in 1990, transferred to Playstation discs and called a video game.\n\nWCW vs The World was developed and published by Japanese companies, Asmik Ace Entertainment and The Man Breeze, which would probably explain why there are only 13 WCW wrestlers in the game, while the rest of the roster is fictional Japanese wrestlers. That's right folks. Only 13 WCW wrestlers, while the rest are made-up Japanese wrestlers that have never even remotely been heard of. It's kind of a waste of a game if you're not going to include all of the WCW roster and have a bunch of created wrestlers take up space.\n\nThe only arenas you can play in are house show like arenas. There's a WCW house show like arena and the rest are Japanese arenas. To add on to the Japanese theme in this game, there's cheesy music that loops throughout the matches that sounds like it would've been acceptable in a 1980s Japanese action movie. There are 7 different modes you can play in this game that are: League Challenge, Best of Seven, Exhibition Match, Elimination Match, Tournament, League Match, and Double Title Match.\n\nIt goes without saying that the move-sets in this game are also very limited. Each wrestler only has about 6 to 7 different moves for you to use until you begin getting bored. Ultimately, once you've played one match, you've played them all. Overall, this game is just horrible. It gets boring within the first 10 minutes before you want to cut it off. A similar WCW game, made and published by the same company would come out later that year; WCW vs NWO: World Tour for the Nintendo 64. It was slightly better than vs The World, but that's not saying much.\n\nBasically if you want to play a better WCW game than vs The World for Playstation, buy Thunder, Nitro, Mayhem, or Backstage Assault. Nitro and Backstage Assault weren't all that good but any following WCW game is 1000x more fun to play than this abomination that is WCW vs The World", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "You wouldnt expect it, but this game is good for all the wrong reasons. If you were to buy this, you wouldnt think the best wrestlers would be the the guys you never heard of right? By far the best finishing move in the game is called \"The Alcapulco\" by some guy whos name I cant remember. Its the most devastating move ive ever seen in wrestling, if he does this in real life to other people, I would suspect these people often become paralyzed.\nI will attempt to describe the move, it starts off as a regular suplex, but once he has the guy verticle in the air, he releases him and comes down into a piledriver. So basicaly your being dropped directly on your head from 6+ ft in the air. A regular piledriver is like 2 ft and you have almost no momentum. Same with a tombstone piledriver. This tops both by alot.\nBesides this one move, the game is average overall, not great, not bad. But this one thing made it better than average for me, worth a look in my opinion.", "label": "good review"}

And this series would be at the top of the list.  Survival horror was shot to the forefront because of this amazing game.\nStuck in an old mansion in the middle of the woods.  You have limited space to carry the scant supplies the game gives you.  Not much ammo.  Not much health.  And zombies and rabid dogs everywhere.  This game was awesome.\nIt does have its issues.  The controls took some time to get used to.  Not everyone cared for the fixed camera angles.  And the voice acting is bad.  So bad its laughable.  Its definitely dated now.  The blood looks fake, the rooms are brightly lit.  And the hunters look almost comical, except their scream, that's still scary.  Also the remake for the Gamecube way outshone it.  Still though, fun and challenging and truly a classic in its own right.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Twisted Metal 2 for the original PlayStation was easily one of the best games for that system and one of the best video games ever made.  The replay value is so incredibly high it never seems to get old.  The graphics maybe out dated but the play control is excellent.  The music is very good and the stages are excellent each with its own unique features.  Once you learn the freeze sequence you can tee off on the competition.  The game is great as a single player and even more fun with multiple people.  The intro and endings are fantastic very well done.  TM2 improves on the first game in every way.\n\nI have spent countless hours playing the game, swearing at my TV and coming back for more.  I love the no holds barred aspect of the game every car vs every other car.  Who doesn't love blowing up Sweet Tooth or Twister.  Each character had their own unique abilities advantages and disadvantages.  There are so many ways to destroy your opponents and it is very satisfying to get revenge on someone who just blew you up.\n\nThe challenge for the game was very even and as the player you always feel like you have a chance to win the round.  The sequels for Twisted Metal never seemed to capture the fun aspect or outstanding play control in this game.\nI think the only flaw in the game was that there was not enough lives to play simultaneously against the computer with no passwords and limited continues.  The first player game is fabulous I would rate that a 10.\n\nTM3 & TM4 all had the same flaw, the cars seem to gang up on you and not fight each other where as in this game it is full on mayhem going on the whole time. What's worse in TM3 the computer opponents would puss out when they had a quarter of a life bar left and steal your health power up which is BS. I would highly recommend this game to anyone 10 and older.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nPlay Control: 10/10\nStory/Originality: 9/10\nChallenge: 8/10\nFun Factor/Replay value: 10/10", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "As most already know twisted metal is a car combat game collect weapons and destroy your enemies as you drive pretty simple idea that can definitely be fun....\n\nSummary:(Read Below if you wanted More Info)\n1= Very good\n2=Great!\n3= HIt or Miss with the more realistic physics\n4= HIt or Miss Imo due to the character design styled more like 1 & 2 than 3\nBlack=First and Best PS2 Twisted Metal Arguably the best Twisted Metal of All\nHead On=Good Gameplay Online Mode included (psp and ps2) Spiritual Sequel to Twisted Metal 2\nTwisted Metal (2012 for PS3)=Didnt play this one but heard it was good\n\nTwisted Metal: A great game, revolutionary for video games of the first 3d era. Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later.\n\nTwisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically...\n\nTwisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral.\n\nTwisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1.\n\nTwisted Metal Black: First Playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name Incognito entertainment.  Best Graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games.  With nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now)  this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series.\n\nTwisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.", "label": "good review"}

Years later, the thing that sticks out most to me is the Soundtrack. There are certain games you hang onto for the BGM's. This is one of those games. The over the top stealth kill and trying to unlock certain items is well and good but the music is the thing that always calls me back.

{"words": "I was brought into the Tenchu series with Wrath of Heaven (not a great place to start...), but after renting and eventualy buying the third Tenchu instalment, I made it a point to track down the originals. I'm writing this review in 2005, a time of Metal Gear Solids, online Splinter Cells, and innovative Hitman games. Yet this title, released in 1998, still impresses, and is well worth effort of tracking it down and buying. Some things a buyer needs to heed however is the lack of analog control. For gamers raised on analog controllers, this game may be a little hard to manage at first. Also, the game, which emphisises stealth and patience is not without a frustrating moment or two, as the camera can be troublesome in places, and there is no in game save feature (try spending 2 hours working to get a good rank on a level, only to be killed by the level's extremely difficult boss, and be sent back to the begining...). All together, the game features an impressive aray of Ninja weapons and items, decient replay value, two playable characters and a good story that sets the stage for several sequels. While it may feel simplistic to gamers hardened on newer stealth titles, and the graphics may not feel as polished, Stealth Assassins is a difficult chalenge and rewarding experience for anyone willing to overlook some simple flaws, and who possesses a good deal of patience. I highly recomend it.", "label": "good review"}

The voice acting wasn't that great but it was at the time when this came out. I think most people's problem with this game (myself included) was the annoying camera angle at time but once you got used to it, it wasn't that bad. Definately a classic game in my book.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This collection of games from Namco is a blast from the past for anyone who grew up playing video games at home on Atari or who spent their entire life savings at the arcades.  The games included on this collection are:  \"Ms. Pac Man\", \"Dig Dug\", \"Galaxion\", \"Phozon\", \"Pole Position II\", and \"Tower Of Druaga\".  For those who don't own a PS2, NAMCO MUSEUM VOL. 3 is worth owning because of \"Ms. Pac Man\", \"Dig Dug\", and \"Galaxion\".\n\n\"Ms. Pac Man\" is just as fun to play as the original \"Pac Man\" but is just slightly more difficult and gives a more continues the \"story\" begun in \"Pac Man\".\n\n\"Dig Dug\" is one of the classic arcade games of the 80s.  The game seems easy enough to play (dig your way through dirt, kill monsters before they kill you, and collect vegetables). However, the game becomes increasingly difficult as you progress and before you know it your running away more than you are shooting at monsters because there's just too many of them.\n\n\"Galaxion\" is another arcade classic.  It takes the premise of \"Space Invaders\" one step further so that instead of defending a planetary base from destruction and invasion, you're in space trying to destroy an enemy fleet before they blow you up.  In \"Space Invaders\" you could hide your gun behind turrets, but there is no place to hide in \"Galaxion.\"\n\nThe other three games on the collection are fairly forgettable and were somewhat obscure in the day.  \"Phozon\" is a type of puzzle game where you try to match up the phozons with the pattern without getting blown to bits.  \"Pole Position II\" is a racing game where you blow up if you get too far off course or run into items.  In that sense its realistic. However, the game is extremely difficult to play because the analog component of the paddle isn't compatible and you don't have a joystick so you're forced to drive your car using the directional buttons. What a pain.  \"Tower of Druaga\" is the final game on the collection.  It involves trying to get Gil to climb through all the levels of the Tower. It's kind of like an early video game version of role playing. It's kind of interesting, but it takes an incredibly long amount of time to defeat.\n\nOverall, this is a great collection for anyone who grew up playing video games in the 80s.  For those who are too young to remember Atari, the game is nice to play because of its retro and anything retro is cool.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Maximum vintage gameage!  This game is packed with the best (and worst?) of the arcade days.  First, there's Ms. Pac-Man...though this might be the Japanese version; the Midway one played differently.  Galaxian is the precursor to Galaga; maybe it should've been on Volume 1 instead?  Phozon is based on the atom principle--you collect the various atoms (with your X-shaped thingy) to form various shapes matching the one(s) in the background.  Dig Dug, also back, features that guy in a suit digging in the underground, collecting fruits/vegetables, and dropping rocks on (or blowing up) Pookas [little bouncing orange creatures with big eyes] and Fygars [basically small dragons].  Pole Position II is the sequel to Pole Position; this time you have your choice of 4 tracks to race on.  I didn't play Tower of Druaga much as I don't care for that game.  Don't forget, you can also check out knowledge/history of the games in the various Museum virtual rooms; there's even a stack of NG magazine covers in the Library!

Most people don't give Dig-Dug the credit it's due - it is very entertaining - even for adults.  I rather liked Dig-Dug in the arcades, and this is a good rendition.  On the other hand, \"Phozon\" and \"Tower of Druga\" are very forgettable, \"Tower\" the most worthless of the lot.

{"words": "Introduction:\n\n When i bought my playstation i had now clue of any twisted metal games until I played this one. I never was able to get my hands on the first one but this one is amazing.\n\nThe Game:\n\n Twisted metal is a car compitition almost like demolition derby except with crazy characters and weapons. Many games have tried to copy this gameplay but none could ever create one like this. The competition is held by Calypso and he gets people in search of help to join his competition and if they win through the 8 levels of demolition they get one wish from him. Calypso is all in this for entertainment while the characters are in it for something important.\n\nThe Good:\n\n This game is one of a kind and has many good points. First of all is the gameplay. It is replayable and you can chose from any vehicle/character and take him through the end of the game and see his ending story. All of the characters are unique in an individual way and they each have their own special to terminate enemies. There are plenty of weapons to pick up and fire at opponents like the homing missile and fire missile and napalm. The levels are well designed and there are eight of them to battle through. The co-op mode makes the game especially fun but takes away the story aspect at the end. Also each vehicle makes their own sound when using there special.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n The graphics can be a little bit choppy at times and many of the obsticals are flat. Some of the story lines are not worth playing through the whole game, you just have to be careful who you pick.\n\nConclusion:\n\n Overall the game is excellent and is a must buy even if our deciding to buy it now and you have a ps2.", "label": "good review"}

When I first played the game it was love at first sight, no one-night stand here, this one's a keeper. The game takes place in Feudal Japan; the game starts at the time period and impressively stays there through the entire game. You won't find anything you wouldn't find in the time period (Yes, Feudal Japan did have guns). Some people would complain about the over-exaggerated bloodshed and the sometimes-cheesey dialogue. I must disagree with these people these two factors made me enjoy the game even more. \"What the hell!?! Why would that make a game better?\" You maybe asking, well those two features made me feel as though I was watching an old Japanese Kung-Fu movie, minus the kung fu that's how I believe you must think of this game to fully enjoy it. After watching the ending I believe that's the effect the creators wanted to put in this game, after seeing the end sequence yourself you'll know what I mean. Of course the bad camera angles sometimes made this game annoying. In order to block your opponent's attacks you must hold down which a lot of the time backed you into a corner....

{"words": "I am a latecomer to Tenchu. Since it is a PS1 game its graphics really show the PS1's age against the PS2. However if you are willing to accept/ignore that difference you will find Tenchu a very satisfying and deeply fun game. This is most definitely one of PS1's best games.\nThe game becomes more enjoyable the better you are able to master your ninjitsu skills. The controls are difficult to master at first, but stick with it and you will eventually be rewarded. I used to just jump off a roof and try and hack at my enemy. Now I can do a reverse back flip off a roof behind an enemy and exact a perfect kill. Far too cool.\nPros:\n- Many many ways to finish a level.\n- Stealth is heart throbbingly fun.\n- Plentiful cheats for amateurs.\n- Wonderful soundtrack. I ended up buying a copy of the soundtrack too.\n- Variety of ninjitsu moves makes killing stylishly fun.\nCons:\n- Since it is a stealth game you have to be very patient to make sure no one can see you before you go for the kill. This can take a long time.\n- Each level is long and the boss is at the end of the level. Dying in the boss' hands means you have to start the whole level from the beginning\n- No saves during a level.\n- Joypad controls are difficult to master- but are necessary to support all the ninjitsu moves.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I actually did purchase this game two times.  I lent it out some years ago and never got it back. I recently noticed that the price is very modest so I picked it up again.  Why? This game is an older generation game (PS1), but it is better than some PS2 games I have played that only advertise graphics but have poor gameplay or short game time.  Tenchu is a satisfying game that lets you creep around, slice necks from behind, and hide out on rooftops. You will avenge the death of a crooked merchant, rescue a captive nijna, save a princess, destroy a fiendish cult, stop the spanish pirates, and fight a big boss with a bigger sword. Of course there are those who opppose this type of activity and thus will try to stop you.  Its lots of fun running around, hiding, killing from the unseen.  Its better while doing it while the great game soundtrack is playing.  This game has very catchy music that brings you you right in. The graphics, like I said, are mediocre, but that won't make or break a game anyway. Gameplay makes the game and this game has plently. Plenty of enemies to defeat, two selectable characters, a bunch of ninja items to utilize, and the percect amount of levels.\nWhat isn't so good about the game? Each ninja only has a small amount of stealth kills to use. There are plenty of regular attacks to be diverse but only 3 stealthy kills. One kill is rarely used due to the fact that you have to be iun front of you r enemy to use it which is dangerous because he will see you. You usually do the neck slice (yawn).  Another downside is that many of the ninja items you acuire will be useless.  Since you can only carry 4, you will take ninja stars, bombs, paralyzing rice cakes, and the grapling hook.  The others are junk or rare objects recieved as bonuses for completing the missions on a master ninja score. Again the graphics are dated. The enemy AI is a pretty stupid. You can run past an ememy warrior and duck behind a bush or tree and he won't know where you went.  He will look around himself quick and resume his patrols, \"Where are you!?\"\nIts still a load of fun and can be a challenge at first to get a perfect rating and unlock secret items. Replay value is pretty darn good. You might get tired of it after beating it with both ninjas, but you will get a taste for it some time later.  This game will not sit in a closet.

This game was really sweet. And after I tried the demo of \"Ninja: Shadow of Darkness\" that was in my game \"Fighting Force\", I realized I was lucky that I didn't waste my money on it.\nI would never trade this game in for that other stupid one. This game is incredible. Going up to guys from behind and killing them with classic stealth kills like the throat slit and the stab from up front. Not only that, but the enemies that you fight in the game are awesome: samurai, ninjas, bears, wolves, dogs, and all kinds of demons. This game is totally awesome, if a bit slow though. It the jumping and fighting action were more like it was in \"Devil May Cry\", it would have been just like playing in a Japanese anime. Oh well, it was still a good game. If you're a true ninja fan, you must have this game... you won't regret it.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This game offers unique play. It has a pretty good storyline that keeps your attention, but the stealth required to play the game makes it a keeper. Unlike Metal Gear, you actually loose points by being spotted, even if you make it through the mission successfully. You can opt to go through the mission again for a higher score, or you can go on to the next mission. I liked that aspect the most because the second time around (knowing where everyone is hiding and waiting for you) you get to get the drop on them! Cool beans.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Unlike the Corny ninja titles of years past like \"Ninja Gaiden,\" \"Ninja,\" and others of that manner.  Tenchu finally takes the  Ninja game to the next level.  Not just a run around and throw stars at  senseless, weak enemies, this game forces you to learn and master stealth  and the art of sneak attack.  The different weapons available keep the  onslaught more versatile, and the different sword attacks seem to stun the  viewer with there harsh and brutal images.  A great game , a great story  line, but still a few small problems.  even though you have a large variety  of weapons they are very limited.  some of the game may be confusing, and  not very straight forward as to what you are supposed to do, and you tend  to run into some very annoying camera views that seem to definately take  away from the game play.  But overall it's a very entertaining game which  i recommend to any action fan.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "The story tells that people were strangely disappearing in the Arklay Mountains, northwest Raccoon City. Half of the S.T.A.R.S., a police group who's always hired when things go really bad, goes in to investigate, but they don't come back. That's when the rest of the group come to Arklay Mountains to see what's happening to those missing people and to the missing part of the team... They would just wish they were never born.\n\nResident Evil is a classic video game series. Unfortunately, the first movie wasn't nearly as good as any of the main games from the series. The graphics might not be great since most of us own next-gen consoles like PS2, Xbox and GCN, but they're still decent.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing, voice acting is a little weird and a little silly, but it's OK. Videogames aren't about how close to reality it looks and feels. If it was, games from the past would be forgotten very quickly. What makes horror games special is how fun and scary they are, and this, along with Silent Hill, is the best horror game you'll ever play.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I purchased this version on my PlayStation 1. This updated version was released a year and a half after the original game's release. Director's Cut was produced to compensate for the delay of the sequel, Resident Evil 2, and was originally bundled with a playable demo of that game.\nThe main addition to Director's Cut is an \"arranged\" version of the game that changes the location of nearly every vital item in the mansion, as well as the enemy placement. The main characters, as well as Rebecca, are given a new wardrobe and the player's handgun is replaced by an improved model where any shot fired has a random chance of decapitating a zombie, killing it instantly. The original version of the game is included as well, along with a new \"beginner\" mode where the enemies are easier to kill and the amount of ammunition that can be found by the player is doubled. Additionally, the auto-aim function was restored in all modes, though it is not noted in the in-game controls so the player must accidentally stumble upon it.\n\nI recommend all RE fans to get this version.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Twisted Metal 2 is one of the best Twisted Metal games, I still like Black better. I liked the movie where Axel goes back to his father and rips his arms out of his machine. I hate the T rating. Buy this game NOW!", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "If you didn't like the original Twisted Metal don't bother Reading this review -- nothing substantial has changed in the sequel. If you liked the original Twisted Metal don't bother reading this review either -- there's plenty of new cars and tracks in the sequel. If you don't fall into the above categories, read on. The Twisted Metal story is simple. Each year, a dozen-or-so misfits and malcontents meet for a battle royale in souped-up cars straight out of Death Race 2000. The last person alive gets any wish granted by Calypso, the man behind the Twisted Metal competition. Your job is to take control of one the these cars in a variety of locations and then blast your opponents to kingdom come. Graphically, the game is identical to the original Twisted Metal. On the plus side, the landscapes are richly detailed and the battlefields are complex. On the minus side, the texture-maps still look horrible up close and clipping and pop-in is still plentiful. The game also controls much the same as the original. This means you will eventually choose your ride based on a combination of 1) how cool it looks and 2) how often its handling doesn't make you want to throw your controller through the TV screen. This time around, there are plenty of tracks and a wider variety of vehicles. It appears that Single Trac listened to the folks on Usenet and included cool new cars like a hearse, a bulldozer and a grotesque man/car thing, Axel, that gives me the willies. Also new to this game are \"special moves\" that anyone can pull off. These include a freeze ray, a shield, and reverse weapons.\nThe game still shines in the two player mode. Life doesn't get much better than chasing your buddy around in a cop car and nailing him with a tazer. In fact, if you are into two-player games, there's no reason for you not to buy this game. Overall, Twisted Metal 2 is a cool game with plenty of replay value if you like beating a game 12 different ways or are into two-player games. It's just a bit surprising that the game looks so much like the original. I guess they decided \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\".", "label": "bad review"}

The ending was a major downer because it falls horrible short.  The soundtrack is at least great but not as a good as the first games.  Tawna being dropped was a mistake because it made that whole adventure in the first game feel like it wasn't worth it.  I can't believe she dumped him shortly after he rescued her for Pinstripe.

It would take a week to kill someone with your machine guns on TM 3 and 4. Actually you would be killed in less than a minute if all you use is a machine gun on TM 3 and 4.

{"words": "This is perhaps my favorite arcade collection of all time. The PS1 Namco Museum series is a very interesting twist on the arcade compilation formula. The innovative things about these games is that you have the option of walking around in a literal Namco Museum, and there are doors which represent each game, whats awesome about walking around in the museum is that each door for each game you go into has excellent build-up and atmosphere to get you pumped to play the game, and since it is a museum, each game's room has a plethera of interesting history of Namco, for example, in the Dig Dug room, you can click on these action figures that are on display and they represent real toys that Namco actually produced. There are also these sort of tips and tricks scattered on the walls of each room, as well as more history other than merchandise. Its a brilliant idea, and luckily, this game has an amazing roster of games. It has Ms. Pacman, Dig Dug which is my favorite arcade game of all time, Galaxian, Pole Position 2, Tower of Druaga, and Phozon which is a really strange sort of puzzle game. Lastly, because of personal bias, this game means a lot to me. It introduced me to Namco and some arcade classics, and some of the museum locations invoked wonder and curiosity in me and they make me happy whenever I see them.

{"words": "The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat\n\nThe Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting\n\nI tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond its major flaws. Flaws such as the abysmal combat system. You can't aim at anything! The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window. The other flaw is the level design. Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost. The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.\n\nAnother thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow! When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable. Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting. They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad. The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is. While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it. RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful.

{"words": "When you ask someone why the Sega Saturn failed and why the Sony Playstation succeeded, most people knowledgeable on the subject don't have a great reason. The best answer I've come up with is that Sony Playstation had some smash hits that the Saturn did not have. Games like Tomb Raider, Twisted Metal, and Final Fantasy VII were mega-hits that Saturn did not have an answer for. One game came very early into the Playstation library and was deemed an instant classic by gamers and critics alike, and that game is the first Resident Evil game, the first true hit for the Sony Playstation.\n\nReleased by Capcom in early 1996, Resident Evil was unlike any game we had ever seen at the time. With an opening title screen that explodes in blood and symbolizes terror, Resident Evil is a game that truly doesn't reveal itself right away. You have the opening story cinema scenes that vaguely explain your elite police officers' reason for venturing out into strange territory in search of your teammates. One of your teammates is killed during the investigation of the crashed helicopter by a strange canine beast of sorts, so the actors run for shelter in a spooky looking mansion.\n\nI won't rehash everything about the game, but I believe it is important to try and recapture the feeling of the first time playing the game. It's pretty difficult to describe. The music is perfectly eery and sets the tone grandly with stringed arrangements you would hear in a suspenseful terror film. You walk around trying to find clues about what is going on in this strange mansion. Bizarre zombie creatures roam around desperately seeking to sink their teeth into your fresh blood, you try and find better guns to deal with these creatures, and you also try and find the keys to unlock the doors without knowing what terror lurks on the other side. On top of that, the seemingly haunted mansion has traps and strange puzzles that must be solved in order to continue finding your way closer to the end of the game, almost like a spooky mansion in a murder mystery. Horribly mutated dogs crash through windows when you least expect it, and the ammunition in the game is in a very limited supply, so you are forced to make snap decisions whether to stand and fight or run for safety. Scattered throughout the game are personal correspondence, diaries, and logs that reading will give you a clue to the ultimate mystery surrounding what the hell is going on.\n\nBefore this game, the story regarding Umbrella didn't exist. Ironically, this kind of makes the game more mysterious. In other games, we already know about the Umbrella corporation's role in the story, so this game is a unique experience of unraveling the truth. On top of that, this game takes place in the Spencer Estate Mansion, which is the perfect terrifying setting for this unique gaming experience. There's nothing wrong with the second and third games taking place in a Precinct, but a haunted mansion crawling with the undead is just perfect.\n\nChris and Jill are the playable characters, both with their strengths and weaknesses. Honestly, Jill's game is much easier. She gets the bazooka, which Chris does not, and is given the lockpick at the start of the game in place of having to find the Sword Key. Jill also has 8 inventory slots to Chris' paltry six, and because Chris has no lockpick, he has to find small keys to open the locked drawers for ammunition. Having a small key clogging one of Chris' six inventory slots is quite a nuissance, especially since Jill does not even have to bother wasting one of her eight inventory slots with the lockpick. Finally, the obvious reason for Jill's easier game is in her companion, Barry Burton. Barry is very helpful and will heal Jill from a giant poisonous snake, give her acid rounds for the bazooka, help her to get the shotgun and will even torch the massive Plant 42 for her, while Chris is forced to rely on the inexperienced Rebecca to learn to play piano, find serum for him, and mix up a potion to injure Plant 42. There are ways to alter Rebecca's actions to make her a bit more useful, but in the end her assistance is not as valuable as Barry's.\n\nToday, the polygon graphics that were so compelling during this age of gaming do look substantially dated, and the voice acting, which was considered atrocious even when the game was new, is laughably absurd. But who couldn't use a laugh after the horrors and suspense of playing this game?\n\nWe all know the storyline of the game, and most of us remember all the thrilling moments to the point where they have lost their sharpness over the years. But take yourself back in time for a minute and try to remember what this game felt like to you the very first time you played it when you were much younger, and games were much different. This game felt like nothing we had ever played, and no gaming experience was even close to what we got from the playing the original Resident Evil. Back then, there was still alot of social debate whenever a game came around that featured a significant amount of violence, yet Resident Evil was so unique in that it literally felt like being trapped in a scary zombie movie. There wasn't much debate surrounding the gratuitous amount of gore like there was with other games (Mortal Kombat), and instead gamers and critics were unified in their praise of the game's excellent and unique gameplay and experience.\n\nGamecube would later revamp the game with updated graphics, better voice acting, and many new thrilling surprises, but you just can't beat that feeling you got when you first popped in this game not knowing what to expect. This game has one of the greatest legacies, and is every bit deserving of all the accolades accumulated since.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "The original Resident Evil is the purest example of a survival horror video game. The newer RE iterations, while fun in their own right, are not survival, and some would say not even horror video games.\n\nResident Evil throws the player into an old, dilapidated mansion with the vaguest notion of zombies on the prowl. The original party is split up to investigate the area, and the player is left to find clues towards a path to safety.\n\nUnlike many games supposedly within the Survival Horror genre, Resident Evil hits the nail on the head with the notions of staying safe. Enemies are best avoided, as direct combat can result in being quickly overcome with zombies or being poisoned.\n\nItems are hidden throughout the mansion that detail just how the monstrous zombie outbreak started, and to a lesser extent details the lives of the individuals who lived there during the initial stages of the outbreak. There are pictures of their families and friends, their clothes tucked into their closets, and, on occasion, the zombified individual himself, trapped and desolate in a bathtub or a wing of his home.\n\nPlaying the game, one truly gets a sense of being stranded. In essence, it puts the player in the perspective of every human being there during the outbreak. You never know who or what has been turned, nor where those beings now dwell. Caution is the only priority, and this game capitalizes on that.\n\nWeapons are not found sitting out for any person to find. The player must actively search for items to aid in his or her quest. Guns are definitely there, but they would be about as well-hidden as a person living inside the mansion would have them. The control scheme may seem archaic now, but for the genre, the controls are spot on. Maneuvering through a hallway full of zombies should not be an easy task, and given the options presented, it really isn't.\n\nPuzzles are a central (albeit quizzical) part of Resident Evil's gameplay. In keeping with the survival elements, some doors are locked; to pass through them, the player must find the key. This involves searching room-to-room around the mansion, and solving the occasional puzzle. These elements are definitely well-aligned with the gameplay, but from a strictly survival perspective, some puzzles fit the scheme better than others.\n\nThe plot is weaved strongly through the course of the game. Many of your allies are found dead throughout the mission, consumed by the horrors of the mansion. Others are as desperate as ever to get out, while some are a bit too satisfied hanging around. The plot is advanced mostly through cut-scenes where characters interact with each other. The voices, as all know, are pretty hilarious (or bad, depending on your perspective). For the time, characters using voice-overs as opposed to text was revolutionary. Unfortunately, the voice acting didn't stand the test of time, and some of the more hilarious quips are almost inside-jokes among video game fans.\n\nThe graphics were definitely of the era. In 1996, this game's graphics would astound any who saw it. Twelve years later, they are clearly dated. Many games of this era can't stand the test of time (strangely, games of the 16-bit era age more much gracefully, and even modern games have become throwbacks to the visuals of that time period), but Resident Evil fares better than many Playstation titles. Many of the pre-rendered backgrounds are highly detailed and set the mood wonderfully. Given the polygon count of the day, its pretty easy to tell where your character stands against the backdrop, and conversely, where the enemy stands. Thankfully, the color schemes applied to enemy and ally serve to blend objects and backgrounds together seamlessly.\n\nThe sound is more forgettable than anything in this game. The soundtrack does serve its duty well in creating and maintaining a frightening atmosphere, but there's just not anything noteworthy enough to stick out after over a decade. The sound effects, while not fantastic, serve their purposes extremely well. Given the player's mood, one would still be prone to jump when a noise is heard off-screen.\n\nWith a game as old as this one is, it would be easy to find faults -- especially comparing those faults with current-gen gameplay mechanics and graphics. However, if one can allow themselves to enter the early PSX era, the true beauty of a game like Resident Evil can shine through. While not perfect, this game serves as the ultimate example of what survival horror is. RE set the stage for things to come, and its great to be able to go back and see the humble beginnings of some of the greatest plot elements and gameplay mechanics we enjoy in video games today.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Mortal Kombat is a totally cool fighting game series. Digitized and bloody fighting combined with neck-breaking, spine-ripping fatality moves make the series seem like gold. But I personally find the transition from 2D to 3D for this series scary at first glance. I originally thought the fatalities would end up being like horror movie scenes. However, I ended up sticking with it.\n\nIn Arcade mode, there were about 5 or 6 difficulty modes. In Mortal Kombat on the SNES, I played well on it. In Mortal Kombat 2 on Game Boy, I was able to tackle Hard mode. In Mortal Kombat 4 for Game Boy, I can beat Master mode, but that version of this game was too easy. Here, I got my butt kicked even on Normal mode! The game is pretty challenging, but I think if a player's good enough, he can whop through easily.\n\nThe gameplay is traditional Mortal Kombat fighting action. There are also some new moves, such as twisting someone's leg.\n\nThe graphics are also really great, especially considering some of the Nintendo 64's limits, such as the 2D blood during the Game Over screen.\n\nAnd of course, the sound is top-notch.\n\nThere are very few fighting games for the Nintendo 64, and this is your saving grace for your virtual strength.", "label": "good review"}

That is what this baby is, glory. A truly excellent game, with excellent graphics, for its time and it's, for this nerd at least one of the fondest memories of my wasted childhood I have. In fact this is one of the things I spend countless hours mastering that I don't regret one bit.\n\nThe control is simple and responsive, which I like. This game to me was my first introduction to actual video games, sure I'd play Mario or Primal Rage or what ever on the old SNES. Then one fatefull day young Kazuki Ferret was (at age 8) introduced to Resident Evil. The game for him, challenging puzzles which tested intellect, well designed levels and characters, and o' course guns.\n\nLooking back now, this game was an excellent first for the giant we know today as the Resident Evil series. With such classic games as RE2, RE3, Code: Veronica, and RE4 stemming from it. This game is a simple must own in your video game collection, if you see a copy and don't own one; buy it is what I say. I got the copy I have for $5.00, which is an excellent price for such a classic game. There is no reason not to own this game.\n\n-Kazuki Ferret, 'The Angry Resident Evil Nerd'", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Today I posted a review for Silent Hill for the Sony Playstation in the interest of fairness I figured I'd post a review about Resident Evil. Like Silent Hill I played and beat the game within a week of it's initial launch. I didn't have alot of gripes about the game being as I was blown away by the very idea of a survival horror game. Let alone playing such a game for the first time in my long gaming history.\n\nThe music and graphics for this game are by no means good to todays standards. Back in the day as with Silent Hill they were top notch or very near it. As far as puzzles go, Resident Evil had both passable and challenging puzzles... nothing that took away from your gameplay or experience which was a nice touch.\n\nAs far as gameplay this Resident Evil game, Director's Cut, was my favorite up until Resident Evil 2 and more recent Resident Evil 4. As I said with Silent Hill neither game is better than the other but I would strongly recommend skipping this game for this system and get the Resident Evil Remake for Gamecube.\n\nThe remake enhanced not just the graphics but the over all story and appeal of Resident Evil, the original classic survival horror game. In closing I have to say that I graded this a 3 as I did with Silent Hill, they are two different kinds of scares and two different worlds but the graphics and dated sound leave me empty. All-in-all a must buy for any Resident Evil fanboy or person looking for a quick cheap thrill.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "Forget the fact that this game came out a long time ago.\n\nChris Redfield and Jill Valentine are your two main playable characters accompanied by Barry Burton, Albert Wesker, Rebecca Chambers, Brad Vickers, Enrico Morini, Edward Dewey, Forest Spyer, Richard Aiken, Joseph Frost, and Kenneth Sullivan most of which will end up dead before the end of the game, which isn't revealing much as most people know about this game.  One of the main points of the story is the isolation and being alone searching for your fellow teammembers.  If there's 12 of them in all and the main idea of the game is isolation and terror you better believe you'll find some dead teammembers along the way.  The story is pretty much known around the world.  STARS Alpha team has been sent to investigate STARS Bravo team's dissapearence in the woods near a mansion that belongs to Umbrella.  The T-Virus (Tyrant) has been let loose and killed the employees turning them into zombies, and unleashing other creatures (Hunters AH!).  The game itself really isn't that long,  once you learn the puzzle solutions you could breeze through it in a few hours (for which you may be rewarded).  The Arrange mode on this Director's Cut version features different uniforms for Jill and Chris and some different camera angles and puzzle solutions.  Items will be switched around to different locations as well.  The overall \"scare\" factor of this game is pretty nil, but you might jump at a few spots.  The graphics are dated, sure, but they're basic and likeable.  You can tell what's going on and still see extra details (unlike the remake where the entire game is a pile of details upon the next pile).  One of the most famous  aspects of this game is the voice acting and FMV sequences with actual actors (if you even want to call them that).  The in game voice acting, when you actually find a fellow STARS member alive, is pretty terrible.  I'd like to track these people down and see if they haven't been murdered because of it.  The FMV sequences are pretty classic also, the opening is the same for eather game and the endings are different depending on who you save during your adventure as Chris or Jill.  FINAL NOTE:  I highly recommend this game (the Director's Cut version since it has 4 games total) even if it is extremely old to anyone!  The \"explicit scenes of blah blah) at the beginning of the load don't really make a difference as it's all squares anyway, but this game is actually REALLY fun to play through.  I think anyone who has moderate video gaming experience should play this.  You might have to get used to the controls, but they don't really bother me.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "This is where the Crash Bandicoot games got really, really good. Everything that the first game got wrong; the second game got it right. The second game was released in 1997 as a PlayStation exclusive called Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back; obviously reference to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. This game is also available on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic to be played on either the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable or PlayStation Vita for only $6 so Id recommend getting that version if you are interested. Developed by Naughty Dog, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios, the second game was better than the first game in pretty much every way. The second game takes place immediately after the first one as Doctor Neo Cortex survives the battle against Crash in the first game and decides to use crystals to power the Cortex Vortex to take over the Earth. He decides to abduct Crash Bandicoot to gather the crystals making him believe he wants to use the crystals to save the Earth. We also meet Crashs sister Coco who is suspicious of Cortexs true intentions. Meanwhile, Doctor Nitrus Brio who was Cortexs right hand man wants Crash to gather gems so he could destroy Cortex and the Cortex Vortex orbiting Earth so we are presented with many people wanting to side with us, all with different intentions.\n The gameplay is a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across 30 levels to gather crystals and gems. The game takes place in a series of six Warp Rooms which as the hub areas of the game. Each Warp Room contains five portals leading to a level. The goal of the level is to obtain crystals and gems throughout the path. Crystals are placed somewhere along the path whereas gems are obtained by either destroying all the crates, or in bonus levels or secret levels; once you obtain the crystal or gem, you have to reach the end of the level, if you exit the level by using the start menu with a crystal, you will lose it. I guess they made it that way to be hard. Once you obtain all five crystals in a Warp Room, you then have to ride the platform in the center of the room to move to the next Warp Room, however you have to fight and defeat a boss character before gaining access. Ripper Roo is back as a boss who is one of the more interesting bosses as he goes from a genius scientist to a mentally unstable psychopath when Crash hurts him, I cant help but laugh at this. Then theres the fight with Tiny Tiger across floating platform that drop, the goal is to have Tiny be on that platform when it drops and in true cartoon fashion he floats in the air for about a second and then falls, I love that. I was kind of disappointed that the final boss fight was too easy, but whatever.\n The gameplay is like the first game except with new controls, Crash can now slide across the ground, perform a body slam, crawl on all fours and even slide across the ground and jump immediately to reach higher places. Some enemies can only be defeated by one of these methods so the game has strategy which is nice. The boxes are back which once again have to be broken in order to obtain extra lives and gems. But whats nice is you can die and still get the gem without having to restart the level like with the first game. A new famous box is the Nitro Boxes which explode upon any physical contact, but fortunately there is a green colored box with an exclamation mark on it that will explode all the Nitro Boxes in the level once struck. The game also features bonus levels which contain hidden boxes, extra lives and even gems.\n As a kid, I played the s*** out of this game. It was only recently I managed to beat it 100% because it is both challenging and fun, but its easier than the first game so if you were expecting a greater challenge, you will be disappointed, but the controls, smoother gameplay and the fact you can save anytime you want as long as you are in the Warp Room makes this game a far superior game than the first one.\n\nFINAL RATING: 9.5 out of 10", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "A decent ps1 classic but not really true 3d platformer like croc or mario64 of the same era. I never understood why crash is restrained to levels that are basically hallways, very linear, not much depth. Yes you still get '3d' movement but its restrained by limited levels so it almost 2.5 d in a sense. Graphically this was one of the noticably low polygon games that suffered from flickering and sometimes missing polygons on characters and levels. the 32 bit era polygon games have not aged well. Graphics suffer from texture warping, poly flickering and jaggies and it doesn't help that the ps1 had the worst video ram,system ram and resolution of that generation of systems. This has to be a very common game from the ps1 era, I cannot understand why people think its disc based version is worth north of 20. Hello people, wake up, there is a psn digital version for 5.99. Since when does a digital psn re release warrant a skyrocket in disc version prices. The value of a game should be based on rarity and a greatest hits game that has be re released digitally is anything but rare. Do yourself a favor don't pay more than 10-15 for the disc version anymore and your over paying.

{"words": "I had this game given to me for free years ago on the PC format. I liked it, but for some reason it crashed on me one day and I mustve done something to the disc, 'cause it never worked or would reinstall on any computer after that.\n\nAll these years later I've just picked it up, second hand, for the N64. And I must say there is not really any difference between the PC version and the 64 version, which is a good thing!\n\nThe only difference is in the movies. The PC and I 'spose gaystation version had the movies & ending in video form, where as the 64 replicates them the same way using the polygons of the 3d characters themselves. I have no complaint about it, I like it wether it's video form, or 3D poly form. They both still tell the same story. Except Reiko who just walks off into a portal.. the other versions show what happens when he goes into the portal, he puts on his Shoa Kahn mask!!!! shame thats not in it.\n\nAll the codes and moves where the same, and I like the fact that the PRACTIVE mode allows you to press pause and choose a list that displays all the characters moves, fatalitys and weapens etc... tho, i'm really kind of sick of the combinations of move lifts, which makes it great to just go into the options, highlight \"continues #\" and hold down block+run untill it takes you to the hidden menu where you can turn on auto fatalitys and stuff.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about the game is what it should have had included. It needed to be fixed so that the auto fatalitys worked like in MK: TRILOGY (All platforms EXCEPT the N64 version) where each button freformed a diffrent fatality (2 fats, freindship, babality etc..) that about it.\n\nThis game is one of the best head to head fighter games. Unfortunatly the team at Crapcom decided to make a billion versions of Street Fighter for every other system... talk about over kill... but they didn't wanna make one for the 64, so thats there loss, which means Mortal Kombat is the best head to head fighter on the 64 if you ask me.\n\nThis game is actualy converted to the 64 straight from the arcade and then extras where added in after that, which makes it better then the arcade. Like the fact you can play as Goro & Noobsaibot, and a skinless character named Meat (go to GameFaq,com for the codes)\n\nMK is the best head to head fighter on the N64 in this realm.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Though officially the 4th installment in the MK series, Mortal Kombat 4 followed one upgrade game, a compilation game, and a Sub-Zero spinoff game, making it around the 7th actual produced game for the series. It was the first game to utilize a 3-D engine, and the first MK game to feature weapons combat.\n\nWhile the 3-D engine was a refreshing change of pace after the stale, sprite-based animation of the previous entries, in truth MK4 gets dull rather quickly. Without the 3-D engine, it's pretty much the same as previous installments, only with less characters and less finishing moves. The idea to finally drop the silly finishers like Friendships and Babalities was a good one, but once you go through all the finishers and stage fatalities, you've pretty much seen it all. The basic fight engine is solid, but feels a little too simplistic and generic. The pre-programmed combos were toned down, which should be a good thing, but after awhile you miss the 'wow' factor that came with delivering them. The sidestepping button doesn't really do enough to change things, and weapons are so easily lost that its not worth pulling them out except for the coolness factor.\n\nMK4's still decent and worth buying if you find a used cartridge around, but only because the N64 seriously lacked solid fighting games. The Playstation had plenty of 2-d and 3-d fighters that made MK4 pale in comparison. It's still fun to go a few rounds with friends, and its a nice pre-cursor to the more advanced Deadly Alliance and Deception, but the game just doesnt leave you satisfied.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "Resident Evil: Director's Cut (1997). The PSX re-release of the 1996 survival horror game.\n\n  Back when the PSX was first released, the system didn't have much in the way of standout games. Of course, there were a few noteworthy PSX launch games like Twisted Metal, Doom, and Tekken, but for the most part, the PSX didn't have anything outstanding yet. Thus, Resident Evil was made. Taking influences from the earlier survival horror series Alone In The Dark, Resident evil took all of its aspects to the next level and eventually became one of Capcom's most successful franchises to date, ranking just behind the Mega Man and Street Fighter games. In fact, the original RE game was probably the first PSX game to make the system worthwhile before other important games were released in the following years.\n\n  Most everyone who's played the games already knows the story, but for those who haven't, here's a brief synopsis: A strange murder occurrence just outside of Raccoon City has caused Police officials to be suspicious, so they sent two Special Tactics and Rescue Squad (STARS) teams to go investigate. You play as either Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield, both of them surviving STARS members. The teams end up getting stuck in the mountains, so they eventually find themselves inside a huge mansion, where the STARS members discover numerous creatures such as zombies, mutilated dogs, giant spiders, and other monsters. These were all created due to Umbrella Corporation's disastrous T-Virus. As the game goes along, more important discoveries are made.\n\n  Now let's talk about the game itself.\n\n  Of the three PSX RE games, this one easily has the worst graphics. We're talking first-generation PSX graphics here, if that's any indication. The character models are all blocky and easily stick out from the otherwise highly detailed still-screen environments. These environments are navigatably 3D, but the camera angles sit at fixed 2D points, which can be both good and bad, depending on the situation. By bad, I mean that some angles hinder the view of the action. The monsters (especially the zombies) have very limited animation and models compared to the later games, and its limited engine prevents the game from having more than 3 monsters on the screen at one time (not including the crows). So the only real decent graphical aspects are the rendered environments. But even they don't quite compare to the detail in the following games.\n\n  The sound effects are good for the most part. However, the zombies come off sounding more like moaning old men than actual monsters, and the voice acting... dear god? don't get me started. It's so hilariously bad that it's just fun to listen to. The dialogue doesn't help things at all along with the horrible acting which is bad even by B-movie standards. One of my friends almost died of laughter the last time I went through the game. The music on the other hand, is decent and suits the mood of each area appropriately. It's nothing special, but it does add to the overall suspense.\n\n  The controls are something that most people either love or hate. It took me some time to get used to them, but now I have no troubles whatsoever. Most people that hate them don't seem to realize that RE isn't just an all-out action game, but rather an exploration puzzle type game with action segments. The controls were a bit rough here, though they have been more refined in later releases. I do admit though, that it does get very tedious backtracking to the item box again and again because you can't hold all the items you want to. Between the two playable characters Jill and Chris, I personally found Jill to be the better one to control because she has more inventory slots and weapons than Chris, although Chris's voice acting isn't quite as nerve-grating as hers is. Both characters each have their own sub-character that helps them along game, such as Barry who helps Jill, and Rebecca who aids Chris.\n\n  Most people have said that this game was the scariest of all the RE games. I'm not sure I agree with that, but the atmosphere can be quite chilling at certain points. I suppose that the dogs breaking through the glass windows could've scared newbees to the series, but since I was introduced through RE2 and the fact that I've already played the MUCH freakier Silent Hill games, the original didn't scare me nearly as much as it should have. To the game's credit though, it does present the most puzzles, and a majority of them are real brain-benders. It's something that the series started to get away from as time went on. Plus, I thought that the game itself felt larger than all the others in the series, so it will take a while for new players to beat it. The challenge is also very high since there is very limited ammo to take out the creatures with. Even veteran RE fanatics still find the first game to be thoroughly challenging enough to come back for more.\n\n  This version of the game is a director?s cut edition, but it?s really nothing special. All we get is an extra mode that is more challenging and features different outfits for the main characters, but if you already own the original, there?s no need to get this version. Apparently the Japanese version also had extra cut-scenes, so we were cheated! So much for it being a ?director?s cut?, huh?\n\n  Although this game is extremely dated by today's standards, it's still worth checking out if you're a big fan of the series and want to see how the series got started in the first place. However, it's not really necessary now that a MUCH better remake is available on the Gamecube, so I suggest looking into that game instead. RECOMMENDED SPECIFICALLY TO FANS OF THE SERIES. NEW FANS SHOULD START WITH RE 2 OR THE GAMECUBE REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL FIRST.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "This game is a few years old, of course, but I was so pleased with it that I played it all last night after it was shipped to me. Definitely the best fighting game for the fading N64 platform. It is somewhat easy on the easy settings (almost too easy mind you), and as you increase the challenge level, the computer opponents increase in ability almost 10 fold.\nThe only gripe that I have is that some moves are just not condusive to being made on the N64 controller. My hands also wanted to keep sliding over into the traditional n64 grip on the controller (with the stick and not the pad), but this game does not play well with the stick and thus you have to use the pad. That will feel weird at first. You can re-map the buttons to better suite your needs, but if you do, other moves will be more difficult to pull off as well. For instance, Sub-Zero's famous slide is almost impossible to do without taking your right hand off the controller and repositioning it on the correct buttons to make him do his slide. While you're doing this, you're getting your butt kicked because how are you going to concentrate on where the buttons are during the fight?\nI still give it 5 stars because those problems are not really that significant in the long run. The combo system is wonderful, and anyone who is looking for a good fighting game on the N64 console should pick this one up. With the price that it is at now, it is very affordable too. I highly recommend it.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "The very first 3D Mortal Kombat offers great graphics, new 3D worlds, the return of several fighters, tournaments, 2 on 2 kombat and much more. Scorpion, Goro, Reptile and others return to the game with a few new fighters, however the bad part is that all of the new characters have similar powers as the old characters that were not in the game. Another bad part is that unlike the past few Mortal Kombat games is that this game is very quick to beat and it lacks challenge. To make up for it though, there are the most awesome fatalities of any game, such as Scorpion's very realistic fire, the spinal removal from Sub Zero with a total 3D effect and Liu Kang's throwing his opponent straight toward the camera. Each fighter now has weapons as well to add flavor to the fight.", "label": "bad review"}

From what I've seen, the game has none of the typical warping PS1 games are known for. It still holds up well today.\n\nSound (6/10) - Mostly average tunes here. Nothing I'd demand to put on my iPod, but it gets the job done and fits the game well.\n\nGameplay (8/10) - The game controls well even though you have to use the D-pad, since the analog support didn't exist when the game came out. The game itself is a challenging, fast-paced platformer that moves fairly linearly. It's a lot of fun.\n\nOverall (7/10) - This is a solid game by Naughty Dog, and a great start to an awesome series.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "Capcom's legendary Resident Evil series and I have never really seen eye to eye. Though I own nearly every non-GameCube title in the undead thriller's history, I'd never been able to stand one long enough to actually complete it, right up until this past week. I'd always found the series to be misleading, disguising itself as a straightforward action title before slowing the gameplay down to a crawl and relying on endless puzzles and feats of memory to lengthen completion times. Time after time, I'd sit down with the goal of finally tackling these games, and time after time I'd get bored, stuck or distracted, leaving the game behind. I grabbed Resident Evil 3 when it was relatively new, and the title has sat, unplayed, on my shelf for years. That was, as I said, until this past week, when I sat down with renewed vigor and vowed to complete the first title in the series, even if it drove me to madness.\nI'll make it really blunt; the story is absolutely terrible. The uninspiring characters meander their way through the events without a care in the world, occasionally encountering plot holes large enough to drive an oversized bus through. Nagging issues, such as why somebody would lock their home's single shotgun away in a room that's only accessible through a string of unrelated tricks and puzzles, aren't even touched upon. What if somebody breaks in, in the middle of the night? Is the owner of the mansion really going to have time to roll out of bed, run downstairs, jog to one side of the house, move around a couple statues, grab a key, run to another corner of the house, open a door, grab a fake shotgun, return to the original side of the house, unlock the doors and replace the \"real\" shotgun with the fake? I suppose the story does the right thing by failing to even mention these things, but they'll still tug away at the back of your mind as you play.\nThe graphics of the first Resident Evil really haven't aged well. Humans and zombies alike wander around stiffly and unrealistically, each one looking almost identical to the others. Polygon models are simple and blocky. Textures are pixelated and undetailed, looking more like a game assembled on the Super Nintendo's SuperFX chip than a PlayStation title. The series' characteristic pre-rendered backgrounds are poorly compressed and difficult to navigate in places, forcing players to turn out all the lights and squint their eyes just to make their way through the room. Merging still images with live polygons, Resident Evil plays like a strange amalgamation of the PC classics \"Myst\" and \"Alone in the Dark.\"\nThe bread and butter of any console title, its gameplay, is the one area where you'll really learn to love or hate this series. Rather than bothering with camera angles and awkward environments, Capcom has instead sent players through a series of screens, occasionally containing interactive elements of their own. You'll control Jill or Chris from a series of dramatic angles, never in control of the camera itself. They'll enter a screen on the left side, mosey around a little bit, kill a couple zombies and leave the screen on the right side, immediately entering the next screen from another direction. Though it was a somewhat novel concept at the time of its release, this scheme brought with it numerous problems, the most notable of which was your interaction with enemies on the next screen. It's not uncommon to run full throttle off the edge of one screen, only to find a zombie waiting for you right at the edge of the next. It's a really cheap way to take a hit, and can mean a speedy, frustrating death in later stages.\nLooking back, the control scheme employed here is notably revolutionary. Rather than applying a more traditional platformer's control layout, Resident Evil introduced gamers to a stationary rotation-based configuration. Left and right don't serve to strafe, they stop the character's movement altogether and rotate them left or right in place. Up moves you forward, and down moves backwards. Pressing R1 draws your weapon, and pressing X at the same time fires. It's a scheme that's more appropriate for the kind of stationary gunfighting and marksmanship that's defined the action portions of this series since day one.\nMany of the tricks and puzzles buried within the mansion aren't so much brain teasers as they are time wasters. You'll realize what needs to be done within moments, but chances are good you won't have the piece needed to do so on your person. It took me about six and a half hours to beat the game for the first time as Chris, cautiously walking around, learning the position of the zombies, figuring out the puzzles, groaning as I realized the piece I needed was sitting in a chest, fifteen minutes away, and repeating that process. The second time through, playing as Jill and remembering which random item I would need where, I finished in three hours and twenty minutes. That's one heck of a variation.\nThe soundtrack to the first Resident Evil is really something that's difficult to categorize. Imagine, if you can, a blend of symphonic suspense, the song that plays when you push \"demo\" on a keyboard, and elevator music. That's Resident Evil's melody. The composer tried to capitalize on the few \"jump out of your seat\" moments the storyline provided, but surrounded by cheesy samples, monotonously repeating tunes and quality that sounds more like something on the N64 than the PSX, there was only so much that could be done.\nOn the large, this was a different kind of game than what we were getting at the time, something fresh. It wasn't a blockbuster, oh-my-god-get-me-the-sequel-now, mind numbing experience. I can understand why a game like this would deserve a sequel, but even today I couldn't have predicted the amount of games it would spawn.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I will confess I never finished this game, but thankfully I won't need to curtsey of the RE-make for GameCube. I had originally started this series with RE 2, and decided to back track to the first one for the sake of finding out who Chris was, and why Claire was looking for him. However the horrid control, horrid graphics were bearable, but the lousy voice acting was not. I couldn't stand it because here was a great classic B-Movie story (and I love B-movies) with F-Movie acting. Everything about this game became cheesy. I then bought the director's cut hoping for better voice acting... well at least I got my wish a couple weeks ago. I then bought the dual shock edition.... yeah, I'm kind of bitter, but I won't hold a grudge because Capcom and Nintendo provided me with what I wanted recently. But this game could have been better, even for the time it was released; at least the voice acting could have been better. Now that the remake is available with all the good things about the original intact, plus some fiercely improved graphics, sound and dialogue (although I miss the \"Master of Unlocking\" line) there is no need to bother with this game.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "RE is a game that not only the first game that took more than an hour-and-a-half to beat, it was a revolution in video game playing.  It was the first in it's time.  The first game to have actual 3-D characters, rather than the suposive 3-D design that \"Doom\" and \"Duke Nukem\" bragged about their choppy, cardboard design.  Now that the movie of \"Resident Evil\" is out, kids and teenagers will be rushing out to buy the RE games.  For an aparent reason, the original RE isn't being sold anymore, rather that it's very, very rare and probably costs around 70 to 80 dollars.  Instead, they're is the Director's Cut. The DC is a odd version of RE that most people will be mistaking by the name.  No, it isn't more gorier, and no, Deleted Scenes not included; seriously.  Originally, the DC version had a much more explicit graphic beginning, with blood and all.  But due to censorship and problems with young kids bying M-Rated games and watching R-Rated movies, the scenes were cut out.  The only real different thing about the Director's Cut is the different costumes availible and items are in different spots. This will leave already RE owners high and dry, while satisfying non-RE game owners.  Anyways, the story.\nIn RE, a group of Special tactics commandos, known as S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) are dispacthed to a secluted mansion in the middle of a remote forrest.  The mansion once harvested top secret government experiments, lead by a Evil Corporation known as \"Umbrella\".  After the first squad, Bravo Team, was shot down from their helicopter and diseapeared without communication.  The second squad, Alpha Team, was sent to rescue them.  But a few scuffles with unknown creatures, leads their helicopter leaving them in the middle of the forrest.  In panic, the team finds refuge in the mansion. But little does the team know is that their troubles just begun.  You have the choice to either play Chris Redfield, a ex-marine turned SWAT commander, or Jill Valentine, a strong guided commando with the ability to pick lock doors and locks.  Through out the game, you must survive in the mansion. Your enemies are Bio-infested Zombies....that's right, zombies.  The problem; you're running low on ammo.  The story goes together, much like the basis for Sam Raimi's \"Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn\" or George Romeo's \"Night of the living Dead\".  Complete with FMV cut-scenes, that include, no less, Screen Actor Guild rejected actors with terrible acting and bad dialouge (\"You almost turned into a Jill-sandwich!!!\"), but never the less still a fun game.

{"words": "When it comes to Crash Bandicoot I'll be the first to admit playing the three main games on the PS1 in reverse order was probably a bad idea. The thing is Warped was the only one I had on hand when the urge to play these titles struck, and well, it completely spoiled me. I'm sure people are probably sick of me gushing over it but Warped was an excellent product and it was refined to the point of near perfection that I honestly wouldn't hesitate to give it a ten out of ten in conversation or review.\n\nThe problem with Cortex Strikes Back is it isn't as polished as you'd expect. I don't mean this in a superficial way like graphic fidelity (which is superb for when it was released) but a \"streamline all the cheap-shots out of the experience\" way. The level of cheapness ingrained in Crash 2's gameplay is simply astounding and it comes from a variety of places. Things like the hit detection on the belly flop are in dire need of work and the bonus areas are usually the furthest thing from fun when that's the exact opposite of what they should be. Worse yet are the game's hidden paths which are essentially sorry excuses to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the player. The kicker to is just when you think you're done and your guard is down - that's when they throw the kitchen sink at you.\n\nThe above situation is a real shame because when you get right down to it Cortex Strikes Back is a beautiful game. The level design and music are excellent as are the graphics which I feel even give Nintendo 64 games a run for their money. But every time the game turns a corner and those memories of the game's stubbornness start to fade something (again, there is always something) shows up and makes it take center stage once again. Compounding the situation is the fact there really isn't enough variety in the levels. Seriously, if I see another level with the words \"Crash\" or \"Bear\" in it I am going to scream and the same goes for the jet pack levels.\n\nAnnoyances aside, if your a fan of the PlayStation having the three main Naughty Dog-developed Crash titles in your library is a no-brainer. If you haven't played them and want to do yourself a huge favor and play them in order so you'll be able to appreciate the improvements each sequel brings with it. Unlike some franchises the first three Crash games get better and bolder with each step. As for the game being discussed here, Crash 2 leaves a lot to be desired to in my book but then I can't really say I dislike it either. I do wish it was a little better (polished) than where it stands now but then that probably a part of why Warped is so good. So while I would definitely warn others of game's cheaper side I'd still recommend it to anyone with an interest in platformers.", "label": "good review"}
