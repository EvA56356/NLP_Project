{"words": "This is exactly what I needed.  It was easy to mount and supports my 40 inch TV (26 lbs) without any issue.  I haven't tested the extension brackets, but the rest of the device is very solid.  I will say that the hinges can be a bit tight, and it's not designed to be easily adjustable on the fly (you'll need a few tools).  If you plan on swinging your TV around a lot, this might not be the best choice, but it works perfectly fine if you only need to adjust it every now and then.  My favorite part is the small base.  I didn't have a lot of wall space to mount a TV, and this met my needs without eating all my money.  Keep in mind that you'll want at least two people to mount the TV on this device.  I attached my TV alone by precariously balancing it on a stack of boxes while I inserted the screws.  Speaking of which, I've mounted two TVs on this, and the box included screws which fit both (in addition to many more).  However, you may need a few more washers.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!\n\nMom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).\n\nI knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?\n\nOption #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.\n\nOption #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.\n\nOption #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...\n\nThe mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.\n\nI hope this review is useful. :-)", "label": "good review"}

The adjustable arm is nice, as it is setup in our bedroom. At night the TV is angled towards the bed and makes it super easy for both of us to see up on the wall, and during the day its turned in another direction towards my desk - also making the ability to view the TV while working.\n\nThe material is very strong, hubby did a pull up on the bar and it didn't even budge.

It's already been up for over a month and it was a wonderful addition to my master bedroom, I'll be purchasing more over time for the other rooms in the home with larger model TVs.", "label": "good review"}

Hex head lag screws that are included which are a breeze to drive into the stud.  I purchased a mount previously that had a phillips head on the lag screws and that really made them a job to drive into the stud.  Since the TV was rather large (400x400 vesa mounting pattern) I had to use the extension arms off of the main plate as shown in the picture.  They were surprisingly very easy to attach.  A nice plastic cover is included which slides back over the wall mounting plate to conceal the mounting screws - I thought that was a nice touch.\n\nOverall an excellent product and I would easily purchase another if I had another TV to wall mount.", "label": "good review"}

So, for this VideSecu mount, inspite of poor installation instructions, I carfeully measured all domensions to fit my new 32\" Samsung LED SmartTV in a limited kitchen space. My mistake was, based on the diagrams, I assumed that the length of both the swinging arms of the mount (the single and the double arms) were of the same length. What a disaster! After installing the mount when I mounted the TV and folded the arms the TV did not center itself to the wall side of the mount! It was then that I noticed the inner length of the 2 arms is about 4\" longer than the outer single arm. In other words once the arms on the mount were fully folded in towards the wall my TV was not centered in the limited space that I had and looked awful. I don't know why the manufacturer did not keep both arms the same length. At least they shd have mentioned it in the instructions.\nThis to me is a major product defect.

It mounts with a VESA 400 x 200 pattern, which is in the product description for this mount, but was not clear from the 3 options given in the documentation. To mount 400 x 200 you need to attach the extensions horizontally. For some reason this possibility isn't mentioned as one of the three options A, B, C which all have the extensions going out diagonally. The mount itself is 200 mm high, so you just need to extend it out to the sides. Another reviewer mistakenly thought it was not possible to mount a 400x200 TV (understandably given the documentation), so I wanted to leave this info here for anybody who needs it.\n\nMy basement room is wood paneled with 3/4\" knotty pine, but there was no stud close to the location I needed the TV. So I attached another 3/4\" wood mounting plate to the panelling with 6 construction screws, then attached the mount to that with the included lag bolts. The total thickness is now 1 1/2\" and feels very solid. I even was able to attach a Roku box to the mount with a couple of rubber bands which keeps it out of the way, but the IR remote still works.\n\nAs far as cons: the only one is that it's a bit stiff to move around. However, if like me you're just going to set it and leave it, that should be no big deal. All in all highly recommended for a solid, but inexpensive mount.", "label": "good review"}

The holes don't align so I couldn't put two screws in. I just used one screw which is not the most secure attachment. Then I used zip ties to secure the arm better. I did this because I had to install the tv ASAP and could not wait for a replacement. Also, the mounting bracket that attaches to the wall has a larger screw hole on the bottom. This means that the bottom can wiggle and the bracket will be misaligned. Again, I did a quick fix. I gave this 2 stars and not 1 because it actually stayed up on the wall and is now holding my tv, albeit due to my own ingenuity and not the quality of the mount.

The great thing about this unit is that everything is included in the box--screws for the back of the TV, lag bolts to screw into a stud wall, even a small wrench to make the tilt and leveling adjustments. Very high quality product. Buyers should note that an electric drill, drill bit, Phillips screwdriver, and ideally a 1/2 inch rachet socket (a 1/2 inch box-end or open-end wrench would do) are needed, things that some households might not have in their toolbox.

{"words": "I am a recent convert to gum. My dental hygienist gave me a sample and told me of the way it promoted good dental hygiene. I loved the flavor and subsequently tried most of the Orbit gums until I settled on Wintermint.\n\nAccording to a card enclosed with my sample this gum works by causing increased saliva, which in turn neutralizes acids. Another point made by the card is that the increased saliva can also help prevent early tooth damage and decay. While I am sure most chewing gums will trigger an increase in saliva, this one is sugar free.\n\nNutritionally a stick of this is less than five calories, contains no sodium, and only a single gram of carbs. It's sugar-free (otherwise I doubt it would have the ringing endorsements of the American Dental Association), and it leaves my mouth fresh. I typically chew a piece between meals to keep my mouth fresh and to add one more layer to my dental hygiene regimen. It's too early to tell how effective it is in the long term, but my mouth feels cleaner.", "label": "good review"}

This is one of the gums which I have experienced that loses its flavor almost instantly!

The strawberry flavor doesn't last long, only a couple of minutes and quickly goes away. I really didn't feel that it could be a flavor I would want to continuous buy. Instead, I definitely think that Wrigley's should really consider making this flavor stronger to the tee, than this would be a flavor I would recommend for anyone that needs a quick chew on the go.\n\nPrice: D\n\nTaste: C\n\nOverall: C-", "label": "bad review"}

Beware of misleading listings.\n\nAlso, the cinnamint is probably the weakest flavor.  Even fresh packs (I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run) can sometimes taste stale.  This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes.  Tasting all flavors, the peppermint by far outlasts this flavor and most of the others.

It was a few dollars more expensive but I love having coffee at Starbucks cafes, so I figured it might be worth it. First, it is ground so coarsely that I must grind it some more in order to use it in my home espresso machine. Second, it seems to be among the more bitter of any grocery store espresso coffees that I have ever bought. Even with milk and sugar, I could not mask the bitterness. I won't be buying it again.", "label": "bad review"}

If you get heartburn, this is a good choice.....I would defy anyone to tell it's decaf. I bought mine @ TJ Maxx @ a steal! Don't know why it was so low priced.....possibly due to the May best buy date.....I bought in March, or that it was in the old blue print bag? Don't know, but I got one 12oz bag of the whole bean and even bought a cheap coffee grinder for it. After trying it, went back and bought 3 more bags.....wish now, that I would have bought a case. The price was phenominal - ending up being .50/oz, compared to Starbuck's price of .81/oz and Amazon's price of .74/oz. I REALLY did get a great deal at TJ, but alas, that story's over. Amazon's price is good and this is where I'll order going forward, now that I'm hooked!", "label": "good review"}

I set it in the 17' x 20' living room where it leads to open kitchen, hall way and the stair case. I wanted a heater I could use before I officially turn on the centralized heater which blasts through the entire house. This heater does the job. There is no annoying sound, no burning odor at the first time plugging it in as some previous posts suggested, I keep it on lower heat and never leave it on unattended ... meaning that the unit is ON when I am in the room where I could see it.

If you are looking for a heater with such feature to shut-off automatically as some other units being sold at much higher price, obviously this one is not for you. It all depends on what you are looking for in terms of buying a space heater. My budget to be spent for a heater was no more than $60 and I am glad I bought this Lasko model 5160.

I have used about every type out there and always come back to this whenever I need a quality tape job that is exposed to anything like under the hood or outdoors. I have used those less expensive bulk brands because I tend to cheap out at times and I usually end up regretting it unless Im using it for something I don't care about like holding some wires together in an enclosed box. Those cheaper tapes will not hold anything for long when exposed to heat, oils, sunlight and/or cold. I wrapped some connections  in my engine compartment with this because the tape that was already there was a gooey mess and not holding anything together as it should this tape looks as good a year later as it did the day I put it on. Its pricey but well worth it if you want to tape something thatll hold.

They knew each other two days and suddenly Jack is ready to give his life for this woman, which didn't fit with the Jack we've met in other books.

But in lieu of anything else to read, this is a good bet.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I generally love Allison Brennan and while her books are never heavy on the romance, this book held almost no romance. For at least the first 1/3 of the book Jack and Megan don't even have any interactions with each other. When they finally meet it's instant attraction and jumping into headlong into a full blown relationship. I don't have a problem with that sort of quick falling in love, but in this book it seemed like an after thought thrown in there with little development. Even after Jack and Megan meeting and instantly fall in love there isn't enough interactions between the 2 to really draw me into the story.\n\nAs a straight novel of suspense, it was good. I gave it 3 stars for a few reasons though:\n\n1. I really was expecting more romance if this was going to be marketed as a romantic suspense\n2. The extensive, graphic attention devoted to the torture of the victims and the sexual pleasure the killers get from the torture was disturbing. I don't mind some torture scenes but Brennan described in great detail multiple torture scenes to the point where it finally made me uncomfortable and I started skipping the scenes devoted to the killers.\n3. I understand that giving insight into the killers is a great device when telling a good mystery/suspense novel but I felt she gave too much attention to the killers. Some of the scenes felt repetitive and too detailed. Maybe I feel that way because I don't normally read strict suspense novels, but I would have liked it more if there were less pages on the killers and more on the development of Jack and Megan's relationship.\n4. The conflict between Hans and Megan seemed forced and could have been developed better I think.\n\nIf you go into this novel understanding you're not getting much romance and that there's graphic, at times disturbing scenes of torture, then you'll probably like this book more than I did. I just really wasn't prepared for what I got in this book.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "REVIEWER'S OPINION:\nThis was labeled as romantic suspense, and the mislabeling is what bothers me the most.  In my opinion, it does not have enough romance or development of a relationship to qualify for that genre.  This is mostly mystery suspense with a lot of uncomfortable torture scenes.  95% of the story is about the authorities finding clues and slowly unraveling the mystery about serial killings.  The small amount of romance consists of a couple meeting, working together on the case, and getting together at the end.  I didn't get the feelings of anticipation or enjoyment that I normally expect from \"romance\" novels.  Once in a while I will enjoy a straight mystery because the characters pull me in, or the dialogue is interesting, or I feel good while reading it.  But this book didn't have those effects on me.  I think mystery lovers will like this more than I did.\n\nI had a minor problem with the smart good guys doing a couple of stupid or illogical things.  Megan was stupid and careless toward the end which caused a major problem.  Hans was angry at Megan for reasons I felt did not make sense or fit with his character.\n\nSTORY BRIEF:\nMegan is a by-the-book FBI agent investigating veterans who had been tortured and killed.  Jack is a former veteran and now a soldier-for-hire.  He joins with Megan to find the killers after his best friend is killed (one of the victims).  We learn early in the story who the killers are (Ethan and Karin) so I'm not giving anything away.  Ethan was with a group of soldiers in Afghanistan.  He was captured and tortured for three months by the Taliban before being rescued.  He is suicidal and loaded with mental problems.  Karin wants to learn torture techniques, but Ethan won't teach her.  Therefore she convinces Ethan that he needs to capture and torture the veterans who were with him at the time, saying they abandoned him.  She plans and helps him capture the vets, and then learns by watching Ethan stick needles into them.  The main mystery is finding the killers, but a second mystery is why Karin wants to learn to torture.\n\nDATA:\nStory length: 424 pages.  Swearing language: strong.  Sexual language: moderate.  Number of sex scenes: 2.  Total number of sex scene pages: 12.  Setting: California, Texas, Colorado and Arizona.  Copyright: 2009.  Genre: mystery suspense.", "label": "bad review"}

Julia and Chandler have a history and it's not a happy one since it centers on the time when he resigned from the police force. But Julia's niece, Emily, is in trouble and Conner has helped out before as a private eye to help find Emily and Julia needs him now since Emily's stepfather has been murdered and Emily looks like the prime suspect.\n\nJulia, Conner and Conner's brother Dillon work together to sort out some strange happenings in their area and track down the killers to help prove Emily's innocence. On the way to that end, Julia and Conner have to work through their feelings from the past and the feelings that they are currently feeling.\n\nLoaded with suspense with a side of romance, plus characters you really like, See No Evil is a great read from start to finish. EAch time I set this book down, I couldn't wait until I could pick it up next and see what Julia and Conner would do. The mystery is intricately woven and very enjoyable to try and figure out. The crimes and the subject matter are dark and handled very realistically but you don't feel bogged down by the whole plot. These characters will stay with you for awhile as well as the circumstances in which the crimes were committed. Ms. Brennan has another winner on her hands and I'm only sorry I didn't read this earlier!", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I really wanted to like this book more than I did. The plot sounded interesting & I liked the premise. My only problem? The writing just didn't live up to the storyline.\n\nThe story surrounds a beautiful DA Julia who must prove her niece's innocence after her stepfather is found horribly murdered in his study. A stepfather whom the niece was being molested by & had plenty of motive to kill. There to help is a figure from Julia's past who holds a grudge and a lot of lust against her, Connor Kinkaid. Moving in the background however is a mysterious group of youths who will stop at nothing to keep their plan moving, even as their shadowy leader pulls their strings.\n\nThis story had so many flaws to it. First off, the characters were interesting in theory, but I just couldn't find myself really getting into the main characters. Connor was fine, but Julia just seemed lackluster. The most interesting characters were the ones never fully explored. The other major flaw is the lack of buildup for who the leader is, why he wanted so many people dead, & how he discovered everyone and pulled them together. His real identity isn't even introduced until the last part of the book & didn't really fit with the story. (He showed up before then, but only as the villain. His persona wasn't introduced or anything until the last part of the book.)\n\nFor that matter, the reasons & wherefores for the rest of the kids aren't ever really explained either. We're *told* that they're all angsty rich kids who were abused (small spoiler, but not really), but it just never seems enough to really explain why they'd do any of that. In the end Brennan goes for the old standard of \"They're crazy, so that's their reasoning\". When we finally *do* get the reasons why, they're so farfetched & unsubstantiated that I found it hard to think of it as a real reason or find it very shocking. There just wasn't any buildup for those revelations, so the ending fell flat. While many would find this entertaining enough to keep them occupied, there's just not enough for me to recommend it as a \"must read\". This is the type of book you pick up when there's nothing else there at the thrift store, not new off the shelves.\n\n2.9/5", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "When Judge Victor Montgomery is murdered in a particularly gruesome way (think severed body part) the police suspect his seventeen-year-old stepdaughter, Emily. After all, blood was found in her bedroom and she apparently tried to kill herself with booze and pills. But Deputy District Attorney Julia Chandler doesn't believe her troubled niece would commit such a violent act. To prove Emily's innocence, she recruits PI Connor Kincaid who'd helped find Emily when she ran away from home three years earlier. Connor and Julia don't like each other, but they're the only people who truly want to help Emily. As their investigation proceeds, an attraction slowly grows between them.\n\nSEE NO EVIL is a good page-turner filled with plenty of twists and turns as the body count piles up. Allison Brennan's novel tells a disturbing story of unstable teens in near-hopeless situations, and what happens when manipulation, misunderstanding and revenge are added to the mix. Brennan does a great job of portraying not only good and evil characters, but the many shades of grey in between. She also steadily builds the suspense so that by the last hundred pages, I couldn't put the book down.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Allison Brennan is becoming a major talent in the suspense thriller genre. This book is no different and continues the stories of the Kincaids and their associates. I loved it.\n\nCarina Kincaid's partner is Will Hooper, seven yrs ago Will was on the task force that caught and put Theodore Glenn in prison on death row. During the course of the investigation Will met and fell in love with Robin McKenna.  She was one of the strippers at RJ's, Theodore glenn killed four other strippers who were her friends before he was caught. The last one was her roommate. Robin found her and has nightmares still, about falling over the body and sliding through the blood.\n\nWill is a detective with the SFPD, he is divorced and has only had short affairs with other women since he lost Robin. Will lost her trust when he didn't believe her about Glenn. She never had an affair with him. Will finds that the news of Glenn's escape brings back all the feelings for Robin and when he sees her, he knows he will do everything he can to protect her and if he is lucky win her back into his arms.\n\nRobin started stripping to pay for college, but every man she has dated has equated stripping with prostitution. She has lost all trust in men until she met Will. She opened her heart to him and thought he trusted her, but his questions about her relationship with Glenn destroyed what trust and love she had for him. Now Robin owns RJ's and it is an uptown night club. Very chic and understated the club has been rebuilt and refurnished while the area was undergoing a rejuvenation. However Robin still sleeps with the lights on.\n\nWhen an unknown fault causes an earthquake at San Quention, Theodore takes the chance with many others and escapes. He knows he is a genius and has made plans already for a future escape so this just moves up his timetable. Now he intends to finish what he started and that is to kill Robin and all the others who put him in prison.\n\nThe story is intriguing and the twists and turns keep you guessing. Did he kill all four girls or is there another killer out there? I could not put it down, but that is true for her other books too. Do not miss this one. Good Reading.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I hadn't even realized a new book was out but I saw this at the bookstore as I was leaving. I made a point of returning to the bookstore later that day to check it out and bought it after reading a few pages. This was excellent, the characters came alive, the writing was great and the emotion just seemed so real. The suspense was very well done and the romance between Robin and Will was wonderful. I felt so bad for them and really felt Will's struggle to make amends for his past with Robin. Robin was understandably hurt, but didn't make a point of dragging things out just to make Will suffer. The angst between the 2 was an important element, but Ms. Brennan did a great job of giving it just the right amount of attention.\n\nAll in all this is a wonderful romantic suspense novel. This is the first 5 star rating I've given a book in a long while, if ever and it is well deserved.", "label": "good review"}

I also thought the female part of this crime group was way too easy to figure out and identify.\n\nI'll read the last one, but not sure if I'll purchase any others.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "The word on the street was that the new WSJ owner would ruin it, and now it seems that the Kindle edition (which had its own problems already, including the price) has been hit with a format change that is a huge downgrade in usability and convenience.\n\nOne big formatting challenge for formatting Kindle editions is that unlike a paper book or periodical, the reader can't readily flip back and forth (sometimes I wish I had two Kindles side by side). The best solution so far is to make sure that there are sufficient hyperlinks for notes, table of contents and anything else one might want to temporarily refer to. The separate Article List and Section Lists can do a pretty good job of this if implemented intelligently.\n\nThe WSJ \"Whats News\" listings used to be on Kindle as a separate section, with its own article list that included the first line of an article and each article was hyperlinked. There were duplicate listings of articles under the various section headings, but so what? You could easily find what interested you to read first.\n\nNow the \"What's News\" listings are all under \"Page One\", with the articles listed in a hard to read series as a single paragraph (a bulleted list would at least be some improvement), with no hyperlinks for the individual articles.\n\nThen THAT Page One \"paragraph\" is hyperlinked to where you finally get the original individual article hyperlinks from a headline cum first line listing. This means more clicking, more levels to find what you want. A very counter productive time consuming change. An \"improvement\" it's not.\n\nBad idea No. 2: The reduction of sections listed in the Kindle \"Section List\" - my preferred default state rather than the article list - no longer includes a \"Letters and Opinion\" Section. Instead the letters and Editorials and Op-Eds are just at the end of the huge continuous \"Page One\" section listing, so you have to page through the whole Page One list to get to the editorial content.\n\nThis change is another time-consuming annoyance that also suggests that the new regime at the WSJ doen't understand the basic concept of journalism that \"news/facts/reportage\" and \"editorial/opinon\" content are not the same thing. The old system made it clear what was what, which gave the reader some confidence that the owners, editors and reporters also were clear on the distinction. Bad move, WSJ.\n\nI also second the complaints about the cost: they could at least throw in the web subscription for the price of the Kindle edition, although I do use the WSJ mobile web version with the Kindle browser to get the market data page.\n\nAlong with the NYTimes, the WSJ is still one of the better Kindle periodical implementations, but it could have been improved; instead we got the opposite.", "label": "good review"}

This book is well written, although, if you have read other books on the subject, there is not a lot of new information.  For me, the real value in the book is the recipes.  I try to eat this way and I am always looking for sources of recipes.  The recipes here are interesting and good", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Co-owner and chef of Primo restaurant in Rockland Maine, Melissa Kelly enthusiastically espouses the Mediterranean lifestyle in her new book, \"Mediterranean Women Stay Slim, Too\", an obvious take-off of the mega bestseller, \"French Women Don't Get Fat\" by Mireille Giuliano.  Rather than focusing on the epicure wonders of one country, Kelly shoots for the melting-pot American approach of multiculturalism and sails the wine-dark sea in search of a metaphorically food-loving Ithaca.\n\nUnlike Giuliano's vignette-styled success, Kelly takes a foodie's approach:  food snobbery and sheer gastronomical delight reign supreme tempered with gluttonless slow eating and small portion sizes.  Her best tip?  Special treats like a scoop of gelato shouldn't be eaten every day, but when one indulges the three-bite rule should be enforced; delight in only three bites and then stop before excess rules over commonsense.\n\nKelly's book cruises along tracking other `real food' diet/lifestyle road maps like the \"Sonoma\" and \"Fat Fallacy\" regimes.  If there is a difference its intaglio is the wealth of recipes that Kelly includes from seasonal staple dishes from menus of her famous restaurant composed of fresh ingredients facilitated by Primo's own vegetable and herb gardens.  After explaining her Italian-American rearing on Long Island (you go girl---I am also an Italian American from Old Bethpage), she divides the book into familiar components---forgive my explanatory license here.  Topics like `high flavor', `variety', `olive oil', `the market and garden', `tapas portions', `whole grain', `meat control', `eating at the family table', `water and wine', `eating little but eating well',  `heart healthy', `living a small rural life', provide a glimmer into the svelte world of the archetypical Mediterranean woman with the addition of health factoids and individual stories that are geared to launch the convenience driven American mindset into a landscape resplendent with a cornucopia of good choices and the breathing room to utterly enjoy and savor the options.\n\nAlthough not your typical diet book replete with dietary dos and don'ts, Kelly does round out her information with a nuts and bolts chapter that answers the obvious questions of how? how much? and when? with a seven day-menu planner that controls portions, includes the wholesome foods discussed in the previous chapters and adds a little meat for a little excitement.\n\nAlong with this, she plugs the idea of balance and contentment which seems to embody the Mediterranean woman and calls to mind that relaxed feeling that one gets even after a short two week trip abroad.  Even though she admits that life in America seems very far away from life in the Mediterranean, she asserts that she \"almost [has] it right\" bolstering her opinion with Charlotte Cushman's words \"To try to be better is to be better.\"\n\nKelly's chatty style reflects the ease she employs to welcome us into her quasi-Mediterranean world.  At times her enthusiasm runs amok and she falls into the same annoying foreign language usage utilized by Mireille Giuliano in FWDGF.  Overtly, Mireille shamelessly uses her `French-ness' to charm her super-sized American audience; sadly Kelly's pseudo sophistication runs the foreign phrase gamut using too-cutesy italicized comments from Gibraltar to Lebanon that annoy rather than instruct and detract from otherwise good information.\n\nBottom line?  While Melissa Kelly's all-American pluralistic approach in \"Mediterranean Women Stay Slim, Too\" works well on the level of providing good information and interesting recipes, it seems that the current marketplace is saturated with so many books advocating real food and slow eating that they all seem to cover the same ground.  Under the guise of learning the newest need-to-know slenderizing secrets of different cultures, we learn only a few simple facts:  Eat well, eat slowly and enjoy life.  Recommended to those who would appreciate some staple Mediterranean recipes.\n\nDiana F. Von Behren\n\n\"reneofc\"", "label": "bad review"}

Mayes took me to places I've always wanted to go, Portugal, Spain, Greece, even Turkey and North Africa. But the book annoyed me, too. Mayes seemed hypercritical, judgmental off-and-on about her accomodations and her meals. She jumped around while describing her setting so that I felt like I was looking at her world through the eye of a jerky video camera. Yet she also wrote poetically at times, describing foods she ate and places she visited so beautifully that I felt I'd eaten, too, that I'd travelled with her. The last chapter is a wonderful summing up of the need to travel that could equally well apply to the need to read as well. Mayes reminds us of T.S.

She, herself, a tourist, hated the fact that other people thought as much to visit the same places. There is a lot of foreign words, terms and phrases to get through. She ate so much food and the descriptions of each meal abound, page after heart-stopping, artery-clogging page. I had no idea I picked up a book about food.

{"words": "As with many of the other reviewers, I loved Under the Tuscan Sun and Bella Tuscany and was looking forward to a similar armchair journey with A Year in the World.\n\nI bought the book the day it came out. I'm finished reading it now, months later. As with a few of the other reviewers, I found it very difficult to get through it. The first half was mostly food reviews and discourses. I was hoping for the wit and one sentence capturing of people and places that she used in her previous books. Not much of what she wrote made me want to visit Portugal, Spain, Naples, Fez and Burgundy. I too was a bit appalled by her lack of understanding for her fellow passengers on the Greek cruise. She had a free trip and basically denigrated the experience. Cruises aren't for everyone, but hey, most of us wouldn't turn down a free one and would try and find the best parts of the experience rather than wallowing in the worst.\n\nIt wasn't until she hit the British Isles that her obsession with food lessened and she became the writer I loved from Under the Tuscan Sun. I did question some of her reviews of British food. I have rarely eaten anything to rave about in England, Scotland and Ireland. It is good solid food and enjoyable, but not something to send one to lala land over the taste and texture and experience. She also managed to bring the beauty of the gardens that the UK is so famous for to me through her words. That redeemed the poorly presented first half of the book in my eyes!\n\nIn the preface she says that she and Ed quit their jobs to write and to explore new possibilities (which includes travel). I do hope future books are a little more rounded. I know that this is more of a memoir than a travelogue in many ways, but it would have been nice to have had a more cohesive picture of the country they were currently visiting rather than constant descriptions of hanging sheep heads and the way to cook them. For me at least, the lyrical beauty of food in her Tuscan books, was just not there for me in this one. Sometimes her descriptions of the places she and Ed were visiting seemed thrown in beside the wonders of their culinary adventures. She obviously feels that understanding the foods and wines/drinks of a place are important to understanding the culture. It just would have been nice if there had been more culture, more people, more descriptions of places than of vegetables and the quest for a perfect espresso.\n\nAnd all this talk of food makes me wonder why she and Ed aren't at least 300 pounds! I've seen Ms. Mayes at a book fair and she is not overweight and not slender model size--just normal. In reading the first half of the book, I found myself wondering how much weight she must have gained! I truly hope that her future writings will return to prose less obsessed with food!", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "I had looked forward to this book so much and I was so disappointed. It was incredibly slow moving which puzzled me until I realized that these were a bunch of college lectures hobbled together. She went on and on about food but after reading Julia Child's book the descriptions were flat not exciting. If you want to read someone who appreciates food, read Child not Mayes. I really couldn't stand how she mocked other tourists because, believe it or not, Ms. Mayes you too are a tourist. If I was that cruise company, I'd send her a bill. She also seems to have a major problem with overweight people. It was a catty, boring book. I wished I had read the reviews before I bought it.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "What would it be like to live in another country? Would it feel like home? Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, tries to discover how one could feel at home in the different places she and her husband visit.\n\nThe whole idea of \"feeling at home\" suggests that an individual needs to discover the in-depth reality of the people, culture and everyday life experiences of each destination. What fun Mayes has as she processes each experience with wonder.\n\nDelving into the history, along with looking through the eyes of poets and writers from these places, she experiences a bit of the past and present.\n\nMayes would make a wonderful food critic, as her description of the large variety of cuisine she experienced makes drooling from the reader a possibility. The tapas tasted throughout Italy, rissoles in Lisbon or food passed around on the flight to Naples is a gourmet experience for the reader.\n\nWhether Mayes and her husband stay in castles, rented houses, hotels, monasteries, homes of people or are cruising to their destination, the delightful experience is thoroughly shared with the reader. It's fun to share in the shopping experiences and see what souvenirs Mayes picks up in different markets and the reasons she and her husband want the items. Treasures they find include a five-pound book from a museum in Madrid, CD of flamenco music in Sevilla, different foods or seasonings, tiles and animal skins.\n\nTravel adventures include Andalucia, Portugal, Naples, Taormina, Italy, Fez, Burgundy, The British Isles, Islands of Greece, Crete and Mani, Scotland, Turkey's Lycian Coast, Capri and Mantova. These are not in chronological order but listed as separate vacations. There is little mention of price for these trips. That may have been for the purpose of not marring the dreamy image of the freedom to go and do whatever an individual desires.\n\nDip into this delightful escape and be refreshed as you feel more at home...away from it all.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "While it is difficult to call anything that Frances Mayes writes \"bad\", she has not met my expectations with this one.  I loved her books on Tuscany and anxiously awaited the publication of this one.  Unfortunately, it falls short of the mark.  I am a person who reads a book from front to back and only rarely skips though it or quits.  With this one, I read the first two chapters and found myself looking for the index to see if I could find anything I found to be more interesting.  I ended up selecting various chapters that seemed to be more intriguing and only read those (and out-of-order at that).  I was able to read most of the book, but had to put it down in between each chapter.  At times I felt like Ms. Mayes was trying very hard to impress us with her vast knowledge of history, literature, food and plants and the writing suffered.\n\nThat being said, there are some wonderful portions of the book.  I particularly enjoyed the section on Scotland and her chapters on Italy were up to her usual standards.  In the Scotland chapter, she shares a country home with friends (in an effort to reconnect with them) and the inclusion of the more personal is very refreshing.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Most of us hope Mayes recreates that magic feeling of place that we all loved in Under the Tuscan Sun. This book strings together accounts from four years of trips to interesting regions of the world (Andalucia, Burgundy, Capri, Crete, Scotland, etc.). She arranges them in season to form a single year, but somehow it failed to hold my interest.\n\nPerhaps it was an overdose of literary references or maybe it was the episodic, travel diary feeling. As a librarian, I probably have a greater tolerance for someone quoting obscure authors or rhapsodizing about literature, but it lost me.\n\nThe descriptions of scenery and food in the different regions fit well with her writing style. \"The slanting light rakes the water. I love the long summer twilights.\"\n\nI tried plowing on through the book just to soak up the vignettes of interesting people, food and places, but found my attention wandering. If you're a fan of Mayes, do give the book a try. Maybe it will inspire you or you will find some destination that lures you to travel.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "I think the best travel essay books transcend the logistics of roaming through exotic locations to bring out a strong narrative thread that illuminates themes more resonant than the author's own self-discovery. Author Frances Mayes achieved a universal sense of liberation and self-acceptance with her most famous book, \"Under the Tuscan Sun\", but despite her immense gift in conveying  the images of foreign cultures, she falls a bit short with her latest collection of essays. Timing also works against her as fellow writer Elizabeth Gilbert has recently come out with her own revealing diary of a year traveling abroad with \"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia\".\n\nWhereas Gilbert undergoes a cathartic experience that transforms her from an urban-dwelling workaholic, Mayes - having already experienced her own catharsis in refurbishing a 900-year old Tuscan villa - already seems well prepared for the pleasures and hazards of travel and often comes across as a dilettante in the way she and her husband Ed hopscotch the globe in search of a feeling of home all over Europe and the Mediterranean. Giving up the security of their tenured university positions, the couple covers quite a bit of ground, and in fact, each chapter represents a unique locale and consequently an idiosyncratic experience. As if hosting a travel series, they go to museums that range from the world-renowned Prado in Madrid to a Welsh museum filled with over one thousand teapots. In a less adventurous vein than Anthony Bourdain, they also dine on the local cuisine whether it is churros in Sevilla or Sally Lunn bread in the Cotswolds or Ed's constant quest for the perfect espresso. Academics at heart, they immerse themselves into the local literature to ensure they are not ignorant before coming to landmarks of historical or cultural significance.\n\nHowever, as with Gilbert's book, the best passages in Mayes' book have to do with the local people that she and Ed meet and get to know. Mayes has a particular talent in describing unique characters like the aggressive, multilingual Istanbul rug dealer who sends notes in miniature looms or the Fez tour guide who loves to quote from Joseph Conrad. These are the people that bring the book to life. Frances and Ed, on the other hand, seem like observers, thoughtful tour guides for the upscale traveler. The author seems to be taking a page from Alain de Botton's \"The Art of Travel\" where he waxes fondly on the multitude of epiphanies brought about by one's own voyaging and mixing the resulting experiences with observations made by the great artists and writers. I just think Mayes doesn't quite elucidate those epiphanies at a meaningful enough level given the hodgepodge approach of their journey.", "label": "good review"}

I like Dermablend for a number of reasons:  it was originally formulated for scar coverage, so the coverage you get is going to be better than just about any other foundation; despite this, it doesn't look caked on if applied correctly; and there are LOTS of shades to choose from.  Because it covers scars very well, it also works just as well for uneven skin colors, blemishes, freckles, and just about any other \"imperfection\" you may have, again without looking cakey.  The foundation is also waterproof so it stays put, and it blends in very nicely so that you can feather the coverage out (no lines at the chin and jaw).  I probably would not recommend this for someone with oily skin, because of the fact that it is waterproof (which means it's probably not water based) but I would check with the manufacturer to be sure.

My face has more of a porcelain color in the winter.  However, I also can sometimes have some red undertones.  Therefore, I bought the warm sienna and love it!  It covers red undertones very well and is a very nice color on my skin.\n\nIt took me a while to learn how to apply this make-up without it caking in creases, and still sometimes it can cake a bit in the creases under my eyes if I'm not careful with my application of it.  I apply a tented moisturizer with sunscreen after any serums.  I then fully load the bottom of the brush with this loose mineral powder.  Then I strongly tap off any excess powder from the bush.  I start at the forehead and apply with downward strokes.  I end by applying it to my neck and decolletage.\n\nIt doesn't take very much of the powder on the brush to cover well.  It stays on very well.  I like the way it feels on my skin, and it seems quite soothing to my skin.", "label": "good review"}

The articles on relationships are interesting.\n\nThis magazine also has sections for: Health & Well Being, Consumer Sense, The Better Way, Food & Home, Fiction, Departments and Columns. The TECH section is always of interest. There is a definite focus on women, as in: \"The Best Cell Phones for Women.\" Plus, this is where you can find Heloise giving out the newest Household Tips.\n\nMy favorite page is the looks, trends, and news page where they always give you ideas for holidays or feature beauty products like Pumpkin Pie body wash in November.

{"words": "Health Magazine is a publication that gears its articles toward a wide array of health- related issues and concerns. When I came across a copy for the first time, I picked it up to read with a degree of skepticism. I thought it would be a magazine exclusively about nutrition, but that turned out not to be the case. This magazine does spend some time talking about healthy eating habits, but this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this magazine. The editors of this publication talk about all sorts of health topics, like mental health, relationships, parenting, physical fitness, etc. Because of this, Health has something that will appeal to almost anyone who reads it.\n\nThis magazine is divided into five main areas: Beauty, Body, Fitness, Mind, and Food. My personal favorites are the Mind and Food sections. I like the Mind area the best because it's the one where I usually find articles that are most relevant to my own health concerns. Here, you can learn about useful things like how to reduce stress in your work and in life, how to deal with problem children, and other informative topics. To a lesser extent, I also like the Food section because it includes some very interesting recipes that show how you can spice up ordinary, routine meals for little cost and minimal effort.\n\nIf there is one thing to criticize about this publication, it would have to be the fact that it is primarily geared toward women. The Beauty section, for example, is focused almost entirely on feminine concerns, with advice on makeup, eliminating wrinkles, etc. Some of these articles could, of course, be applied toward men but they are mostly centered on woman and the models used in the photos throughout most of the sections of the magazine are female. On the flip side, however, my criticism will prove to be an asset for women, many of whom will find this magazine very useful.\n\nStill, in spite of this small criticism, Health is still a very good magazine for all to read. Remember- this is not just a nutrition magazine. The importance of vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins, and carbs comprises only a small part of the publication. The remaining sections of the magazine feature some very useful articles on mental health, relationships, disease control and prevention, healthy cooking, etc., making Health a good publication with articles and columns that anyone can relate to.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "The main target audience of Writer's Digest appears to be freelance writers.  Most of the authors are freelance magazine article writers who have finally `made it', and that is what they write about.  There are a few short articles about writing (usually written by the same people each month), but that is not the main focus of the magazine. A large portion of the articles are about technical topics related to publishing, and not writing.  This magazine is not for people who want to learn about writing; it's more for people who want to learn about how to sell their writing. The advertisements in the back of the magazine are so shady that Writer's Digest actually has to put a disclaimer on each page (think results are not typical in the lose 100 pounds in ten minutes infomercial), and I now get `if you can write a letter like this one, you could make a million dollars a year' junk mail as well.

It made me want to read her books after reading how she structured them.\n\nIf you like reading about the field of writing, and are thinking of entering it or are writing already for publication, this magazine offers insight about the writing world from real writers.  It's a pleasure to read and will probably motivate you to start writing for publication or for the fun of it.", "label": "good review"}

I get it.\n\nThe magazine is really targeted towards traditional publishing, but even self-published authors (like me) can learn something here. And some of the interviews are really great, even if just to gape at how some lucky authors get to live.\n\nThe first issue I received was the August 2009 issue, and it had a pretty good \"Publishing Survival Guide\" in it. The interview was with Anne Tyler, and that alone was worth the price of the magazine. There's also a good interview with Rick Steves (I'm a huge fan). Interestingly, though, they decided to put Anne Tyler on the cover instead of Rick Steves. I thought that Rick would have been a better cover than Anne Tyler from a marketing standpoint.\n\nAnyway, the ads are a bother but the magazine is still worth it.\n\nRecommended.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Writer's Digest is a magazine designed for writers and it attempts to cover many different aspects of writing in its columns and featured articles. Most every issue offers at least one interview with a famous or semi- famous author. This spotlighted author could be the author of a book, a screen writer, or some other type of author. These interviews offer some good insight into writing success and the necessary skills and sacrifices to succeed at your chosen craft.\n\nAside from the interviews, Writer's Digest is basically a magazine of tips and advice. One issue might talk about ways to break into the business of movie reviewing for newspapers. Another might talk about ways to make your writing more concise and less wordy. Still another article might discuss ways to overcome writer's block. The main goal of Writer's Digest is to help the reader become a better writer and, hopefully, gain an offer for a publication at some point in the future.\n\nOne thing that is a little different with Writer's Digest is that it doesn't contain the long list of standard monthly departments like you find in other magazines. With Writer's Digest, the departments are de-emphasized and there are only a few of them in each issue. The rest of Writer's Digest is dedicated to columns and featured articles. This format is unique and it makes Writer's Digest a good choice for those who like change and prefer to read something different in each issue.\n\nWriter's Digest does contain a pretty good number of advertisements, but the ads are usually for writing conferences, writing software, writing contests, or ads that encourage a visit to the magazine's own web site. Because the ads stay so focused on the subject of writing, they don't seem all that bad and they are not distracting. I know some Writer's Digest readers who actually look forward to the ads so that they can find information on the latest contests. And speaking of the magazine's web site, it seems to be an important component of the magazine because it is referenced on many pages throughout each issue.\n\nWriter's Digest is a pretty good magazine for writer and I like it for its advice and classified ads more than anything. The success stories can sometimes get a bit carried away and they make it look a little too easy to land a huge writing contract. It would also be nice if Writer's Digest was published monthly rather than semi- monthly. But Writer's Digest is still a good magazine for writers everywhere, with plenty of good advice and tips to help you become the writer you always knew you could be.", "label": "bad review"}

That doesn't mean you should not buy a subscription as a gift.\n\nThe magazine is perfect for an older person who is not comfortable with computers or someone who doesn't have access to a high-speed Internet service.

They each show a runner in a really cool environment with a quote.  I have some of them hanging on my wall.  I get especially motivated by the one of a man running through the woods when the trees are coated with ice and the ground blanketed with snow.  It looks so beautiful, who wouldn't want to go out and run.  The ask the expert or Q&A section has the most diverse and informative information from month to month mostly because the questions come from readers and the answers come for a variety of experts.  The nutrition section isn't particularly useful.  The science seems simplified to the point that it isn't exactly true, and the suggested menu for one of the carbohydrate dinners starts out with 1 cup broiled swordfish along with five or six other things; not really practical in my opinion.\nRunner's World has a nice coverage of racing events past (results) and future (racing calendars), and my hometown of Boulder, CO is mentioned somewhere at least once per issue :).  Runner's World encourages everyone to be a winner even if he or she doesn't finish first.  It is full of tips for beginners just staring to run and more advance information about training for seasoned amateurs.  Some of the information is useful and some is not, but there is enough useful information to make reading worthwhile.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Hardcore runners will read \"Runner's World\" because they have to. It popularizes the sport, and brings newcomers 'up to speed' about issues and techniques important to them, as well as clues them in on who is who out on the road. a great magazine, except I simply prefer the depth of training and racing issues \"Running Times\" provides a bit more. Really... I wish I could've given this magazine a 3.9.\n\nRunning is a funky subculture, and \"Runner's World\" defines and educates that culture.\n\nSince the late George Sheehan wrote his famous column that emphasized running as spiritual endeavor, \"Runner's World\" has taken on an Oprah Winfrey/Deepak Chopra sort of generalist running philosophy. That's not all bad, as I think the magazine thoroughly encourages fitness through running.\n\nIt isn't all fluff. There is plenty for the more avid runner to soak up. The avid runner will find their marathon coverage, especially Boston and New York, impressive.\n\nTheir running shoes review is what any runner will benefit from. It details every aspect of what makes a great shoe, almost to the point of parody. However, parody or not, their analysis will help you buy the shoe you need for your foot for your distance in your environment.\n\nBuy a subscription to \"Runner's World,\" lace up, and get out on a run!\n\nI fully recommend \"Runner's World.\"\n\nAnthony Trendl\n[...]", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Parents magazine is a very good publication about raising kids to be happy, healthy adults. It offers some good advice about the task of parenthood, illustrating the hard work and rewards that go hand in hand if parents perform their role in the best possible manner.\n\nI like this magazine as a whole, but there are a few things that potential readers need to know about before they pick up a copy to read. First of all, the articles in Parents magazine deal mostly with younger children, below twelve years of age. You won't find much of value in this magazine if you have teenagers. It is intended more for families with youngsters.\n\nAnother thing about this magazine that makes it less practical than it otherwise would be is the suggestions for family activities. The ideas presented here are all pretty good, but the problem is that the majority of them involve outlays of cash and/or time that are unrealistic for most families. I can agree, for example, that adding a game room would make a nice addition to one's house and would add tremendously to a family's time spent together. But how many among us can afford a home addition? Parents magazine talks about activities and enhancements like this in an unrealistic way, making them seem much simpler and easier to implement than they really are.\n\nAside from distractions like that, however, Parents is a very good magazine to read. It's one of the longest magazines you can buy, with 200 to 300 pages per issue. Add to that the low subscription price, a few pages of coupons, and the generally sound parental advice and you have all the makings of a good magazine for young families.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Publications like BICYCLING practically define narrow-casting. Aimed at a modest population that throbs with interest in their shared pursuit, a magazine like this one has to meet elevated expectations and yet recruit enough advertisers to pay the bottom line and maintain an accessible price.\n\nThe result is almost doomed to be something of a hybrid.\n\nIn my book, that's just ok. I read BICYCLING as much for the gear as for the articles on new products, new workouts, and exotic rides. Some months, I'm in it for the advertisements, sometimes for the review, sometimes for the workouts, sometimes just for the sheer pleasure of turning the pages and seeing what I can see.\n\nThat's what one should expect from a magazine like this one.

Here are just a few of the great regular features of each monthly issue:\n- \"As They Grow\", pointers and insights related to a particular subject, one each for eight different age groups (from pregnancy to pre-teen years)\n- \"can you help?\", suggestions from readers about how to handle a common problem, such as the dentist or cutting your child's nails\n- Suggestions to keep your child busy in the house\n- An Emergency Guide pull-out for dealing with various situations like electrical shock, bee stings, etc.\n- Product recalls, usually with pictures\n- Product testing and reviews (similar to Consumer Reports)\nWhy not 5 stars?  There are a couple annoying features in the magazine, such as \"out of the mouths of babes\" and some of the suggestions for children's activities around the house sound easier to do than they really are (sort of like what people say about Martha Stewart).  It can also be a bit of a downer to read the stories about serious illnesses some children have had and how their families cope - not always what you're in the mood for when you're thinking about your own healthy child.  But overall, this magazine is the best one out there for parents AND they are branching out - we recently started receiving Baby Parents.  It's tough to know everything about raising your child so outside sources of information are key.

With a title like \"Lucky\", there were all sorts of possibilities. It could have been about gambling, sweepstakes, or about getting lucky. I didn't know it was a woman's magazine, so I accepted it. And from what I can see, this magazine is one of average worth to the average person and it will appeal mostly to younger women.\n\nFashion covers a good amount of the magazine's 200 plus pages. Beauty tips are another important area of coverage. It is also common to see samples of different products inside the pages of each issue. Things like perfume samples, shampoo, and other things can be found buried somewhere within each copy. The coverage includes casual as well as high- class clothing and beauty products, with most of it falling at the upper end of the cost scale.\n\nIf you can tolerate the clogging of advertisements, this magazine might be a good choice for the younger female crowd that likes to keep in- tune with the latest styles and trends. Outside of that targeted market, however, I don't see much use for Lucky magazine. The photography is very good and the presentation is professional, but the magazine will likely be rated average by a large cross- section of the population.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "I was recently sent a set of Christmas specials in exchange for review, most of which I had never seen before.  One of them was the stop motion classic Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town.  Nope, I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it pretty fun.\n\nAs the special opens, we run into a mail man (voiced by Fred Astaire) who is delivering letters to Santa.  He decides to tell us all about Santa.\n\nIt starts many years ago when a baby was left in the care of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (Paul Frees).  Being the mean guy that he is, Burgermeister throws the baby out.  But he winds up in the care of a family of elves named Kringle who happen to be toy makers.\n\nThe baby grows into a man named Kris (Mickey Rooney) who decides to deliver the toys that his family makes to share the joy with kids everywhere.  But when he returns to his home village, he finds that the Burgermeister Meisterburger has outlawed all toys.  As a result of defying the ban, Kris becomes a wanted fugitive.  Can he find a way to bring joy to the kids of the village?  And what about the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn) who lives between the Kringles and the village?\n\nTo be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this special, and I'm not quite sure why.  Maybe my low expectations were why this one surprised me so much.  I actually got quite caught up in the story even though I had most of it figured out early.  The characters were so great, too, from Kris to his adopted family and his love interest Jessica (Robie Lester) on the good side to the villain you love to hate, Burgermeister Meisterburger.\n\nI'm not a big fan of stop motion animation.  It looks too jerky to me most of the time.  That was certainly the case here, but I actually found it charming.  Maybe I'm softening in my old age.\n\nOne drawback to this short is the music.  Outside of the title song (which Fred Astaire sings so well), all the songs were unfamiliar to me.  Frankly, they didn't add much.  In fact, I found myself wanting to fast forward through them to get back to the story.\n\nNot helping at all was how dated the musical segments were.  This special was released in 1970, and it shows.  I got a definite flower power vibe off the animation during the songs.  There were a couple of other times I felt a bit of that crept into the story.  You might also describe it as psychedelic.  My roommate found this aspect even more annoying than I did; I was mostly able to ignore it and get lost in the story again when it was over.\n\nKids, the target audience, won't notice how dated this is.  In fact, they'll find the 50 minutes over all too quickly.  Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, and he's doing it with plenty of charm to entertain for years to come.", "label": "good review"}

Narrated by Fred Astaire.\n\nVoice Cast: Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney, Keenan Wynn, Paul Frees, Joan Gardner, Robie Lester, Andrea Sacino, Dina Lynn, Gary White, Greg Thomas and The Westminster Childrens Choir (Final Chorus)\n\nDirectors: Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass\n\nProducers: Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass\n\nScreenplay: Romeo Muller\n\nComposer: Jules Bass and Maury Laws\n\nVideo Resolution: 1080p\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1 [4:3]\n\nAudio: English: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio\n\nSubtitles: None\n\nRunning Time: 48:40 minutes\n\nRegion: Region B/2\n\nNumber of discs: 1\n\nStudio: ClassicMedia / Studio: Universal Pictures UK\n\nAndrew's Blu-ray Review: `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was originally a 1970 stop motion television special, made by Rankin-Bass. The film stars actor Fred Astaire as the narrator S.D. Kluger, Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle/Santa Claus, Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock, and Paul Frees in various roles. The film tells the story of how Santa Claus and several Claus-related Christmas traditions came to be. It is based on the hit Christmas song of the same name, which was introduced on radio by Eddie Cantor in 1934, and the story of Saint Nicholas.\n\nThe special was created using stop motion animation called \"Animagic,\" in which all the characters are made out of wood and plastic and animated via stop-motion photography. The special was originally telecast December 14, 1970 by ABC and continues to air every year on sibling channel ABC Family, though both channels have at times edited the special to make room for commercials (ABC has cut two key songs, as well as two other songs in half; ABC Family has cut several scenes that might be traumatizing to younger viewers, like Kris climbing, and leaping to escape to prevent children from doing dangerous stunts, Winter Warlock knowing Kris will return, & telling him he'll never escape including the scene where the Burgermeister Meisterburger character torches the seized toys in front of the children of Sombertown).\n\n`Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was written by Rankin-Bass' go-to writer, Romeo Muller, who explores all aspects of Santa Claus' origins. Narrated by a mailman named Kluger [Fred Astaire], this hour-long special dissects the development of Kris' selflessness, and covers the origins of his beard, hearty laugh, crew of helpers, need to go down the chimney, North Pole residency (he needs to hide from Burgermeister, after all), and pretty much everything in between, providing a hugely creative look at how Santa came to be. On top of being edifying, it's wonderfully entertaining too, full of delightful set-pieces and tender moments of humour.\n\nWhereas today's film makers use 3D computer animation, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was executed with stop-motion technology, using models and sets to painstakingly create each frame. It does look dated and rough at times, not to mention the pacing does occasionally drag, but there's something charming about this primitive technique, especially when you consider just how much work went into every second of screen-time. Rankin-Bass movies often featured impressive casts, with the pair securing at least one or two major names for each production. `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' has two big names, with Mickey Rooney and Fred Astaire both lending their vocal talents to the film. Astaire is a huge asset, guiding us through the story with energy and charm. He has a great singing voice, too, which enlivens the numerous musical set-pieces. Mickey Rooney, meanwhile, submits well-judged work with plenty of heart.\n\nFor over four decades now, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' has been part of annual Christmastime traditions in many households, but mainly in North America, and deservingly so. Romeo Muller's screenplay covers the origins of many holiday traditions - including hiding gifts in stockings and how reindeer fly, while also delivering an uplifting reminder about the real meaning of the season of giving.\n\nBlu-ray Video Quality - This 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray release of `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' features a full 1080p High Definition presentation utilising the 1.33:1 [4:3] Standard Aspect Ratio in which it was originally broadcast. The video presentation looks pretty outstanding for a TV special especially for its age and all of the colours and detail look spot on, easily the best this classic family TV special event has ever been presented. Fans of this TV special should be thrilled with this high definition video presentation and the newcomers to it couldn't possibly find a better way to experience it for the first time. Because it was original made for North America Television, you can see where the adverts were inserted, because you see it fade out, with such a Classic Christmas Special transferred to the Blu-ray format, you think they could of made and effort to edit it in a much more professional way and got hold of the original master tape? I suspect when people viewed this on the DVD format, you would not see the black strings holding up the puppets. But now seeing it in the video resolution of 1080p, you can see very clearly the black string, still after a while you forget seeing this anomaly.\n\nBlu-ray Audio Quality - While it states that the main soundtrack is 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, we are instead treated to a  5.1 channel Dolby Digital soundtrack which isn't too shabby and it's certainly a pleasant surprise to find a multichannel soundtrack of any sort present for such an old special. While as one would expect, the surround element may not provide much in the way of background effects, the special sounds are pretty great here nonetheless and I think overall most will be pretty satisfied with this 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, especially if you have not got the facility of a Home Cinema set-up.\n\nBlu-ray Special Features and Extras:\n\nSadly none has been provided.\n\nFinally, amongst Christmas specials, but particularly amongst those produced by Rankin and Bass, `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' stands apart. It does so because it is most the most triumphantly well-told of the lot, soon I will describe the most cinematic but here we're talking strictly based on narrative. This may just be Romeo Muller's, the writer Rankin/Bass employed, best work as he makes Santa an even more heroic figure because in this tale we learn of his past, learn to think of him as a person not just an icon, and then also have an antagonist who vilifies him and renders him an outlaw. You have, of course, the talents of Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney in this tale and the indelible figures of the Winter Warlock and Bergermeister Meisterberger and of course another classic song. It is an absolutely unbeatable combination and one of the best options for the festive season. Highly Recommended!\n\nAndrew C.

Meanwhile, the mayor of Sombertown is determined to uphold his ban on toys, much to the chagrin of Jessica, who is falling in love with Kris Kringle (Santa). As always, the Rankin Bass specials aren't complete without a message; in this case, it's good defeating evil, goodwill and love over hate and persecution.

The voice-acting is dead-on great. The villains are creepy and give you chuckles once in a away. Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus is heartwarming and pretty good. The claymation was pretty good when it came out and still is to this day. The sets are pretty good and beautiful. The effects are corny but still nice at the time it was done. Overall, despite,some silly moments & plot holes,it's still a great Christmas special to watch every year. I give this special a 10 out of 10.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Santa Claus is Comin' to Town came to ABC first in 1970, when Rankin/Bass was firing on all cylinders. The visual difference between this production and that of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is considerable, especially with regard to the immense, detailed sets and more intricate characters, designed by Paul Coker, Jr. Yes, there is the same animation \"on two's and three's\" as well as a few modest effects, but everything clicks within the brisk 51 minutes, none of which seem padded.\n\nWhen I asked him to name a favorite special (in The Cartoon Music Book) Musical director/composer Maury Laws called this his favorite, because he thought every element was perfect, from the cast to the script to the overall feel. Fred Astaire proved added another dimension to his legendary career as one of the best narrators in any special. Mickey Rooney's bravado was ideal for the young Kris Kringle. Keenan Wynn's Winter Warlock was memorable (especially when he gets the choo-choo). And our beloved Robie Lester (read Mouse Tracks for more about her) was the show-stopper when, as Jessica, she undid the proverbial bun and belted out her solo, a great tune in a score that hasn't a dud in the bunch (though sadly, in today's more creepy times, \"Be Prepared to Pay\" may seem to take on an odd -- thoroughly unintentional -- connotation).\n\nSanta Claus is Comin' to Town is so spectacular that it's the visual crown jewel in the trilogy with Rudolph and Frosty. And sure, it adds yet another set of myths to confuse those trying to figure out the origin of Santa.\n\nIn this case, the story springs from the mind of writer Romeo Muller, but I wonder if, like Rudolph, this special contains a nod to its cultural context. In 1970, Richard Nixon was president, the war was raging and the counterculture was questioning. Kris and Jessica become outlaws and get married in a forest like hippies (since no town would welcome them), and the Burgermeister does resemble Nixon a little. I even noticed that, when Kris says \"It's not even safe here,\" they're standing among the burned remains of what might have been their small camp -- we get a quick glimpse and then it's gone with no other mention. This is the story of Santa as a revolutionary against political oppression.\n\nOkay, enough with the term paper hypotheses. This is Rankin/Bass at their best and glows like a shimmering holiday display on Blu-Ray. For more about Rankin/Bass and Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.\n\nNOTE: If you have the original DVD of Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, you may want to hang onto to it, though, because the Blu-ray contains no extras.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I love how all of these Rankin/Bass classics from the 60s and 70s get classic old Hollywood and Broadway stars to provide voice talents; lends a certain seriousness to the occasion.  Here we have Fred Astaire narrating and singing a couple of songs in this 1970 stop-motion retelling of the origins of Santa Claus.  Fred's a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that's a little corny) with merely the word \"Claus\" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn't want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister's opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire's narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.\n\nThis was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I'd forgotten that the fairly dreadful \"My World is Beginning Today\" is full of cool 60s hippie/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it's interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum's \"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus\" in the pagan/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with \"Put One Foot In Front of the Other\" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.\n\nIn addition to Astaire, the voice talents include Keenan Wynn as Winter, the magician who rules the mountains and tries to stop Claus but is quickly befriended by him; professional voice actor Paul Frees as the Burgermeister and others; and Mickey Rooney as Kringle/Santa Claus, a role he would repeat in THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.  All are very solid, especially Wynn, an underrated actor and a great vocal talent.  Overall this was definitely more fun than I remembered it from my last viewing, probably a decade ago - though RUDOLPH I suspect will always rule my inner child's heart.", "label": "good review"}

It is very effective in watering the lawn, without  spraying water high up in the air (less chance for evaporation, and not  affected by wind as much), and it has hands-off operation once you set it  up.\nAdjusting the spray diameter is easy, and using the hose as a way to  set the travel path for the sprinkler to follow is a great idea.  The  adjustable speed allows you to decide how much water to apply and how much  ground you want to cover in a period of time.\nInspecting the yard  afterwards shows that the ground is nicely saturated, and not needing to go  out and move hoses is a welcomed change. This sprinkler is worth the  purchase price!", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "We have used one of these for about ten years with great success.  The tractor can even follow the hose around gentle 10' radius curves.  The little ramp clips on the hose and has a folding ground spike to keep it  from slipping.  When the tractor reaches the ramp, it pushes a shut off  valve on the belly of the tractor.  Very simple and effective.  Part of our  ramp finally snapped off, but it still works.  We've never had a problem  with the tractor.  The adjstable spray wands allow you to regulate the size  of the area covered.  I suppose it can drag about forty feet of hose before  it slows it down.  That probably will vary depending on the depth and  density of your turf and how straight the path is.\nYou won't be  disappointed; this is a time-tested classic!", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I've always been one of those people that bought the cheapest kind of hose whenever I needed one.  I don't do much in the way of gardening, nor wash my car that often.  So investing in a really good quality hose didn't make that sense to me.  The only flaw in that logic is cheap hoses have a habit of breaking and leaking just sitting there on the reel, whether you use them or not.  So in the long run you don't save much.  That, and the fact that cheap hoses also make you feel like you are wrestling a snake when using them for they are so stiff and kink like crazy.  When I decided to buy a better hose I came across this one and liked it immediately.  It's very well made and just about as flexible a hose you can buy without going for one of those new fangled shrinking hoses.  (I'm not sold on the long term quality of those).  This thing is a pleasure to use, as well as making it much simpler a task of rolling it up when you're done.  It kinda reminds me of what my cheap hose felt like when it was sitting out stretched in the sun for a while.  It would feel much softer and more flexible.  Something this does with or without sun.  Though its true that getting that flexibility carries with it a little more weight in the hose itself, its such a pleasure to use that I feel the trade off is well worth it.  It only takes a short time to get used to it being a little heavier anyway, and I love being able to roll it up on the reel when done so easily.

Couldn't find the shorter D-handle anywhere local so of course went on to Amazon and found several choices. Prices seem to vary from $15- $40 and without being to handle and see what each one looks like I had no idea what was the best choice. This one was one of the best priced handles so just went with that. Turns out to be a really nice USA-Made handle. Stamped steel D handle end is SOLID and heavier than the original one. Has a wood handle grip on the end. Installed easy and used it all day today and very happy with it so far. Thankful to have my favorite shovel back in service. Glad I didn't get one of the more expensive versions because I can't imagine them being much better than this one. Will update review if I have any issues with use.", "label": "good review"}

The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This \"smart-switch\" has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.\n\nDesign:\nOne of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.\n\nThe click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.\n\nThe 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.\n\nThe 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.\n\nThe interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no \"power brick\" to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.\n\nThe included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.\n\nConfiguration:\nI downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features.\n\n' Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address.\n' Change the password - The default password is \"password\", so change it to something better!\n\nThe Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.\n\nThe advanced (and just nice) configurable features include:\n' The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!)\n' IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data)\n' Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video).\n' Port by port Rate limiting\n' Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a \"disable\" setting to turn a port off if desired)\n' Port by port Broadcast Filtering\n' Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check)\n' Multicast control via IGMP snooping\n' Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)\n\nNote: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.\n\nMost users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.\n\nGreen Power Use:\nThe 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or \"dumb\" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.\n\nSupport:\nI did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.\n\nConclusions:\nThe Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.\n\nThe switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many \"dumb\" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.\n\nI had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients' needs. Not so with the Click Switch. Because Netgear has built a compelling product for office (and many other) environments with a fairly rich feature set and easily managed I'm giving it 5 stars.\n\nI'll be placing these into my client environments as new switches are needed. Well done Netgear.\n\nHope this helps someone!", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Overview\n\nThis is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.\n\nUnpacking\n\nThe array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.\n\nInstallation\n\nYou will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.\n\nHardware\n\nAll hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.\n\nThe array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.\n\nOne HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.\n\nI did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.\n\nA nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.\n\nDuring my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.", "label": "good review"}

The packaging was basic and the carrying bag was mediocre,  but inside was a very high quaility and complete set. Exactly what I was hoping for when looking for a set, I also really appreciated the booklet on possible exercises and the thick foam handles; although one more set of handles so you could work with a partner would be nice. I really want to give 5 stars but couldn't,  the point off is for the conflicting information in the booklet. Inside the booklet it states the band's can be stretched 400%, even saying that translates to 1 foot of band can be stretched to 4 feet. Then in the back warnings section, in slightly smaller font it states to only stretch a maximum of 3 times total length. Just saying some clairification or a rewrite are in order. Although , if properly using the band's it seems unlikely anyone could even extend the band's that far. Thusly 4.5/5 stars if I could.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I got these to replace my Bodylastics (BL) which I purchased from Amazon in 2010.  The Black Mountain set is 1/3 the price of my BL set, but the hardware is not as robust.  In addition, these bands are rated a lot higher in resistance weight than the BL.  In the BL set, I used the 8 lb band for arm exercises.  With this set I use the 25-30 lb band.  Feels the same.  So if you really want a resistant band for some more strenuous exercise, these are probably not for you.  You can double up on bands if you like, but that's not the point.  The BL had two attachments which allowed you to secure the band to a closed door and pull against it.  Very good for traveling.  This one requires hardware that needs to be mounted if you are going to use them in such a fashion.  The 25-30 lb band I use provides for smooth, not jerky motion.  I like that.  This has a lifetime warranty.  We'll see.\nOverall: they work.  Good for light workout.\nOn Second Thought: I couldn't figure out why I had ordered a set of bands that required metal brackets for a door.  If you've ever used a set of metal brackets on a door, say to just hang clothes, you know that they: 1) scar the door; 2) usually prevent closing; 3) scar the door frame.  So I rechecked the product display on Amazon only to find out that the bands were supposed to come with a cloth door anchor.  Instead, they substituted the metal brackets.  I returned the whole set.  The cloth door anchor does not mar and permits you to use the bands on trips.", "label": "bad review"}

It comes with the bag as shown, so you are able to conveniently store it or carry it around. I haven't used the ankle strap much, but it is secure. I like doing bicep lifts with these, and I notice the results more quickly than using traditional weights.

As I was packing it into my luggage, I accidentaly turned it on and again when removing it from my luggage.  I had visions of it being bumped during the flight and finding out the light had been on for many hours without my knowledge.  I suppose I could take the batteries out every time I pack it, but don't really like that additional step.

I read the other reviews and that is what prompted my purchase, so I just had to submit my own review to say you really can't go wrong with this light.  I love the flexible arm style, too!\n\nUPDATE: After minor usage over the past 8 months, my Mighty Bright has turned into \"Mighty Broken\".  The company will not replace it, which I do not fault them completely, but the light will flicker occasionally when trying to get it to work.  This seems to indicate a short in the flex arm, although it has not been abused nor does it show any sign of a problem or wear.\n\nAfter realizing it was a goner, I took the entire thing apart except for flex arm itself.  There are no broken solder joints or other obvious problems.  I loved the light enough to order a replacement, we'll see how long it lasts.  I am hoping this one was just a 'lemon'.  For now, I will leave my 5 star rating.\n\n2nd UPDATE: I am happy to report the replacement light has been going strong and has not had any issues.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This is really cute and rather feminine.  Its purple overall with a pretty little frilly heart design.  The graphic has a big heart with several little hearts in the design, and there are styluses and other products that match it available.  The pretty soft lavener and true purple colors should please anyone that likes purple.  The graphic is hip and fun.\nThe bottom of the light is also the battery compartment, and it takes inexpensive batteries, CR2032, which are easily found here on Amazon or most local stores. (Ive even found them at dollar stores.)\nIt works right out of the box, which is very nice.  The package makes a great presentation and would help this light be very nice for a gift.\nIts very easy to use.  Theres a little purple button on top of the light that simply clicks on or off.  The stalk is very easy to direct and aim, and gives more than enough light to read a book at night without bothering a partner.\nThe clip fits nice and tight and is also easy to use.

The total weight is only 1.1 oz. or 31 g.\n\nIt is powered by two pre-installed CR2032 lithium coin batteries in the base and has a push button for power on the head.\n\nThe single cool-white LED is so bright that it is uncomfortable to look at directly and certainly produces enough light for a book, e-reader, or writing pad in the dark.  It could also be used to light a modern floral arrangement from within or for other short-term decorative uses.\n\nThe base has a strong clamp with silicone pads that will attach to objects up to about 1 in. thick.

Designed for children, it can just as easily be used by adults because the monkey is removable. It comes with a detachable clip, making it useful not just for books, but laptop users as well. MacBooks come with their own backlit keyboards, but most PCs do not and I often have a hard time identifying keys on my HP laptop when I'm surfing at night. The flexible gooseneck makes it very versatile as a mini-flashlight as well. It's bright and competes with some LED flashlights I own. If you have a wall plug, you can also use it as a portable nightlight for home or on trips. Just point the neck towards a wall or floor to mitigate the brightness to your needs. The clip also makes it useful for clipping onto hat brims or shirt pockets for various non-reading situations.\n\nAs good as this light is, I do have only 2 minor complaints about the product's design: one is that the monkey figurine feels tacked on, quite literally. While it certainly is cute, the rigid mounting bracket isn't very good. It can fall off easily when handling the light, making it easy to lose. The other issue is that the USB connector feels loose because it lacks the metal sheathe other USB devices commonly have. This jacket allow them to sit snugly inside the port. Without it, depending on the angle of the gooseneck, the center of gravity may affect the connection with the contacts. The only other thing is that the manual could perhaps be more detailed on total charging time and battery life expectancy. Otherwise, a fine and useful light for home or travel. If taking on the road, the monkey should perhaps stay home to avoid loss.\n\nManufacturer provided test unit for evaluation.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Its about time someone designed a book light that you can recharge. Not only is it very functional, its adorable. This 9 inch light clips onto your book, kindle, or sheet music, and gives you hours of surprisingly bright light. When it starts to die on you, pull the stem out of the clip, and plug it into your USB charge port on your computer. Wait a little, then its recharged. (I don't let mine discharge all the way. That way I can depend on it, if I'm away from the computer when it runs out of power.) The problem with these clip on book lights that I always had, is that I fall asleep when I read.  The light would stay on for a few hours, wasting the batteries. Then, I couldn't find the right round batteries for the light, or never put them in, etc. So this light will pay for itself, in batteries saved alone.

I was able to sharpen about 72 bits in my shop in a little over an hour.\nA sharp bit makes much cleaner holes in wood with no burning. And I often use it to sharpen bits right before I drill metal--always makes a cleaner, faster cut and the bit doesn't dance as much when you're starting the hole.\nI don't have any problems sharpening 1/8\" bits, but smaller than that, I just use bits like consumables because they are so cheap.\nThe point has been made that what the DD costs will buy a lot of bits. That may be true if you buy cheap bits, but would you buy a new bit for every project? And what about your time to go to the store to pick the darn things up?\nTrue it doesn't sharpen brad point bits, impact bits, Forstner bits, auger bits, saw blades, jointer knives or fingernail clippers, but what it does it does very well at a very fair price.\nTwo big thumbs up!", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "This is a fun game.  The rules are similar to Gin -- get each card in your hand into a straight before your opponent does and you win.  But instead of suits and numbers each card has a letter or pair of letters, and the goal is to make words.  The first hand is 3 cards, the second hand is 4 cards, etc...on up to 13 cards.\n\nI like this game because unlike Scrabble, the person with the amazing vocabulary doesn't always win, because several short words are just as effective in using up your cards as one long word.  (In fact, you get a 10 point bonus for either longest word OR most words).  So my 8 year olds aren't outgunned by their word-loving elders.\n\nAs a nice plus, the art work on the cards themselves is well done.\n\nThe only minus is that the deck is double sized (110 cards) and so shuffling is a bear.  Would also have been nice if they included a container that held the whole deck (instead it comes with a tray that has slots for 2 half decks.)", "label": "good review"}

I only have to be concerned about the cards in my hand, while playing attention to the discard/ draw deck-easy verses the interconnectivity of letters on a board which only multiply.\n\nEach player starts with 3 cards during the first round and the number of cards dealt increases by one in subsequent rounds.

You play a total of eight hands in which you progressively get dealt more cards, until you reach ten. The challenge is to make words (short or long, it doesn't matter) out of the letters in your hand. You have to use all of the letters in your hand and discard one card to go out. After that, each player has one more opportunity to make words. Then, points are tallied.\nThis game is different every time we play it. We are constantly surprised at the great words we make. This game would appeal to card game lovers, word lovers, and strategy lovers. It would also be a good game for youngsters, as they can use their existing vocabulary (and maybe even win!), expand it, and manipulate it to its fullest.\nAs one of our more simple games, I know this one will be a favorite for years to come!", "label": "good review"}

You have to constantly be thinking of words and new words as the play continues. Once you start playing you start thinking, a refreshing change in a game.\nQuiddler is a true family game game that will certainly challenge even the smartest. You can take this game on the road, camping or even flying and have a great time. For those on a price consciuos budget, this game fits right in.\nAbout the only drawback is the fact that once you discard the card is gone.

{"words": "I was feeling nostalgic last week so I started playing Unreal again.  Probably for my third time through at this point!  While Unreal doesn't have as much replay value as a game like Half Life it certainly does have its moments!  Unreal was one of those really impressive FPS games for it's time.  It boasted great graphics and intense game play.  Of course by 2008's standards these graphics merely look silly!  But if you were picking this up in '98 like I was, you were pretty impressed.\n\nI figure I'll throw in some points about playing this on a more current system, since I experienced some issues here and there.  Being a game made for Windows 98 it doesn't translate perfectly over to an XP 32 bit system.  I have no idea what this would do on Vista's 64 bit architecture.  Basically when re-installing it I got a strange error with the option to \"ignore\".  You can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine.  Strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that \"ignore\" message comes up as well.  I'm not sure if this is just my system, but I recommend saving quite frequently, at least every time you hit a \"load\" screen.  For some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you.  This can be frustrating if you've been playing for a while, because it doesn't auto save between load screens.  Otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system.  You can also get the Unreal Anthology which has been updated to handle Windows XP.  Oh and this was on a Pentium 4, 3.0 ghz system.\n\nThat being said, I'll move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time.  The first thing you notice is that you have almost no health.  You begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner.  Naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship.  The ship is kind of a boring part of the level, but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet.  When you finally get out of the ship the first thing you'll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you.  Outside it's very bright and vibrant in spots.  This felt a little different compared to games like Quake, Half Life, Doom, because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them.  Unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well, but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery.  One thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge!  This was really impressive and fun when you first got into it.\n\nAs you explore and interact with the world you learn more about what's going on with this planet called Na Pali.  Apparently the native people are called the Nali and they've been enslaved by an alien race called the Skaarj.  The Nali are extreme pacifists and I can't help but think their designers wanted them to be Buddhists for the most part.  The Skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game, though not the only enemy creatures you'll face.  They are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit.  You'll notice that the Skaarj design is clearly influenced by Predator.  They have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a Predator.  To brandish even MORE similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms.  As you can see this isn't very original.  Another part that is kind of unoriginal/strange is the Nali castles that you come across.  They are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the Skaarj who have high grade technology.  Strangely you come across large castles that look like they're straight out of thirteenth century England.  I know... strange for a race of pacifists.  Despite all this, those parts are some of the most fun to play through.  I loved going into the castles and running around!\n\nAnother aspect that made Unreal very special, when compared to other FPS games, was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game.  It truly does feel like you're on an alien world.  The sounds, the textures, were all there perfectly bringing you into this world, almost so much that you didn't want to leave!  You even hear echoes off of cliffs if you're walking through a cavern, it's like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user.  For it's time the Unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world.  They also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted.  So when I'm fighting against the Skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots.  This was really cool to see and I really only found that in games like Half Life.\n\nThe maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times.  I really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game Marathon.  A lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers, or whatever, in order to proceed onto the next section.  This game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of 20 to 30 hours to complete, so you really get your moneys worth.  The downfall to having such large maps is it's kind of easy to get lost sometimes if you're trying to complete certain tasks.  Another detriment to the game was the lighting.  I put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where I was going.  Sometimes that wasn't even bright enough.  There are sections of this game that are absolutely dark, especially towards the end of the game.  While this creates a very scary atmosphere, I felt it hindered the game play once in a while.  The reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with.  You have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas.  Now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something, but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes.  Seriously, the flashlights in real life would NOT die so quickly and then it's up to you to go find another one.  The only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light, you can't enjoy the environment nearly as much.\n\nAside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and I had a lot of fun playing it.  In '98 this came out around the same time as Half Life and they were both the must play FPS games that year.  Half Life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line.  Unfortunately Unreal's story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things.  The user doesn't really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles.  Whereas Half Life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control.  Unreal just couldn't compete with something of that caliber and it's not nearly as engrossing on that level.  Beautiful world and really fun to play overall, but not the best of the year.\n\nOverall Rating: 4.5 out of 5", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I loved this game when I first played it (I still play it even today) the graphics where awsome, the sound was cool, the levels where all kinds of stratageys and the expansion pack worked great with it. The cheats to fly the falcon, tie fighters, naboo fighter ect all made the game even better. There is even a secret little mini game where you can control a Chicken Walker (AT-ST) and shoot up some droids and buildings in a small space.\n\nThe only downfall is there is no way to get unlimited heat seeker rockets, so you have to turn on your unlimited lives cheat and keep commiting suicide to get more of those rockets to win within the selected times to get the gold medal to become a Jedi. And there is no nice video's to watch when you finally clock the game. It just shows a quick shot of the ships flying away and then the credits roll... it would be nice to have had a video type of thing like all through the game.\n\nApart from that, this game rocked.. my the Shwartz be with you.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I was never a really big fan of sci-fi, and Star Wars just wasn't my thing. I couldn't really care less about those darned rebels. Obviously, my expectations for Rogue Squadron that summer day were not very high.\n\nBut you know what? I played the first mission and I was pleasantly surprised. The game actually wasn't that bad!  It was actually quite entertaining just flying around and shooting these drones out from the sky. The game really isn't that easy to learn, especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet. There are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that I have yet to figure out, like what right-C does, or how bombs work. But the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy. However, the gameplay got to be quite repetitive. I mean, you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky. Yay. There are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do, and it gets boring. Maybe I could have moved on to the third mission.\n\nI also realized how visually stunning the game is. I have an Expansion Pak, so I really don't have a clue what the game would be like without it, but the graphics are just so crisp, at least certain features. The buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great, almost to the level of Half-Life. But the graphics for the people/Storm troopers leave more to be desired. They are obviously sprites. The music does have a Star Wars feel to it, and that's growing on me. I sometimes get certain tunes stuck in my head, and I don't mind. Most of the music is in the menus, though. 40 minutes of speech is nice, if only I could understand half of it. Rogue Squadron has no multiplayer, which is too bad. It would have been fun. Oh well. Overall, I actually kind of enjoyed this game.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Having played the Twisted Metal series for a few years now, I can honestly say that Twisted Metal III, while having an initial gleam at first play, it wears itself out fairly quickly. The gleam I'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play. It tries to be something new, which it is, but it improves in all the wrong ways.\n\nAllow me to explain :\n\nWeapons Inventory. Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory, you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have. For example, I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more. The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles (more on that in a bit). In previous TM installments, you could keep building your homing missile capacity, and carry only those, as long as you didn't exceed the max capacity. Annoying.\n\nNew Weapons. Okay, so initially I thought the (((Rain Missile))) was the best thing since sliced bread. But really, the rain missile doesn't do very much apart from visual appeal. The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it, and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms. It doesn't do the damage the napalm does, but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire...at least until they turbo (stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers) out of it 2 seconds later. Minimal damage done.\n\nThe introduction of the (((Speed missile))) was the worst mistake of the weapon category. It's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets. If you can fire them fast, you can do some damage, but they're so useless during combat that it really doesn't even matter.\n\n(((Remotes))) are plenty but do much less damage than in TM2. (((Freeze missiles))) (the left-right-up maneuver) do not hit enemies like they used to. It is much harder to freeze an enemy. This can be frustrating.\n\nEnemies. New characters are added, some are great, some not so great. Your enemies now have the A.I. that allows them to steal items from in front of you. If they need health, they will race you for it and take the health. This is especially frustrating when you are fighting Minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health. *Cue controller hitting floor*\n\nThe levels are not very large. Not much scenery and not much to discover. There's a few hidden places you can find to explore, but for the most part it's very limited.\n\nAll in all, TM3 falls flat. The previous installments are much better both in game-play value, and in overall playability.\n\nIf you can find this cheap, get it. Otherwise pass it up.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Well, going into it, I heard that this was SO much better than Quake III arena.  I had played that game, and I liked it.  So, I gave Unreal a go.  After playing for a while, I played Quake III again.  Within a few minutes,  I quit Quake, uninstalled Unreal, and went back to playing Quake.  The  difference in the graphics was incredable.  All the sharp edges are fine,  but I perfer the revolutionaly rounded surfaces.  Quake III blew Unreal out  of the water graphically.  What about the game play?  Well, I was kidna  dissapointed.  Quake III is very intense, the kind of game you get caught  up in.  I found myself playing Unreal, just to see what it was like.  It  had no draw whatsoever.  I thought the weapons were fairly difficult to  use, and were kinda cheesy.  For me, it is all Quake III.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Well, that's what CGW editor Jeff Green called \"Unreal\". After playing it, I'm inclined to agree.

It does look  nice, though, at least for a 1997 era game.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "This has to be the most detailed and beautifully rendered game ever made.  The monsters look real, the weapons look sleek, and the animation is very realistic, with no jerkiness.  Unfortunately, this game requires totally  unreal system requirements!  Anything less than a PentiumII/300MHz  processor runs like garbage unless everything is turned down, and, well,  there goes the graphics!  This game was the chief reason for my system  being upgraded!  Also, remember the sleek weapons I described?  Well,  they're sleek, but that's it.  For crying out loud, it takes THREE HITS  with a ROCKET LAUNCHER to kill one of the BASIC enemies (the Skaarj).  There's no bang to them at all!  Plus, another good thing about Unreal is  the multiplayer games where you can play against computer-controlled  opponents (bots).  Sounds good, right?  Wrong.  Unless you put the skill  level down nearly all the way, simply aiming a gun at the bot will cause it  to zig-zag in a way that is impossible to hit, all while shooting at you  with godlike aim!  Other than the steep system requirements, the  difficulty of the bots, and the bangless weapons, the game is very good and  highly customizable for all those hackers and map makers out there.  You'll  get your money's worth, but I hope you're good at strafing while shooting,  otherwise you'll NEVER win!", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "When the N64 system first kicked off, one of its first titles was \"Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire\".  \"Shadows...\" was a very entertaining version of novel it was based on.  It had challenging, yet rewarding, levels and overall solid gameplay.  However, it had two marks against it.  The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N64 and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards.  The second is that, except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again, \"Shadows...\" lacks any real replay value.  The introduction of \"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron\" (based on a series of very successful novels) to the N64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action/adventure games on ANY platform.\n\n\"Rogue Squadron\" focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron, thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy.  Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles, the squadron fights 16 regular missions (and 3 bonus missions) ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying 'World Devastators' on Mon Calamari.  That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place.  The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around.  No more static matte backgrounds.  Everything is fluid and moves with the player.  The gameplay has also been enhanced.  Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships.  Overall, it makes for a spectacular gaming experience.\n\n\"Rogue Squadron\" also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability.  It awards medals (bronze, silver, gold) for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency.  Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions.  This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met.\n\nThere is only one minor quibble about \"Rogue Squadron\".  In the game designers' quest to make a very demanding game, they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill.  The most glaring example of this is the level 'Raid on Sullust'.  Flying as a (supposedly) heavily armored Y-Wing, one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission.  However, the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12-15 targets that must be hit.  With skillful flying, it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying, but on the life, it's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds.  With only 3 ships per mission, it's impossible to defeat that mission without using the 'unlimited lives' cheat code (which will NOT be revealed here).  However, there's no shame in using that code, and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals.  So, it's a minor annoyance.\n\n\"Rogue Squadron\" raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action/adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet.  Nintendo still gets it, though, as it followed this game with the even more successful \"Rogue Leader\" for GameCube.  \"Rogue Squadron\" is a must have for any serious gamer's library.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat. the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt's palace on Tattoine.\nThe main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission.(use password DEADDACK to get to them)on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do. As for the Deathstar mission, the scenery is wrong. In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench, in the game the target is on the ground. But that's not what bothers me most though, After you hit your target it just says \"Mission Complete\" They should've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up. That doesn't happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfied.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "If I had to pick one word to describe this game it would be amazing.  \"Rogue Squadron\" pushes the N64 to it's maximum power graphically, which can be further enhanced by an expansion pack (I strongly recommend going with one it makes the game run smoother).  The gameplay couldn't be more entertaining, I often wonder how my little Nintendo 64 is able to handle all that this game has to offer.  The missions you fly in this game vary from escorting ground troops into combat all the way to launching full foward attacks on monstrous Imperial ships.  The AI is pretty strong depending on the difficulty level, but when it comes to your own wingmen helping you out just forget it.  Environments in this game are incredible for a Nintendo 64 game and I give the designers alot of credit for putting so much work into them.  Can't get you're hands on the new Rogue Squadron \"Rogue Leader\" for Gamecube? Pick this up to satisfy you're urge, if you do own Rogue Leader or even don't plan on getting it, pick this title up anyways for a hell of a gaming experience.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "LucasArts has really outdone itself with this great N64 game.  After Shadows of the Empire was released, it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level, where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth.  LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept, and Rogue Squadron was born.  You play as Luke Skywalker, leader of Rogue Squadron, a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy, making life difficult for the Empire and its minions.  You play through 16 basic missions, which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back.  The missions range from simple search-and-destroy missions, to escorting supply trains, to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities.  Along the way, you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft, from the X-Wing to the Airspeeder.  Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses, plus each craft has a special weapon, which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions.  After you complete each mission, you may be awarded a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on your performance.  After completing a mission, you can move on to the next one, or else go back and try again to get a better score.  The game gives you a score summary after each mission, so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold.\nThe look and feel of the game is excellent.  The graphics are superb, and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels.  The sound is also excellent for a non-CD game, although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive.  The game is contained within a 3D environment, giving the game a flight simulator-like feel.  The controls are pretty easy to get used to, though this DOES take a little practice.  Fortunately, the first couple of missions are pretty easy, so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls.  The controls are the same for each ship, so you don't have to switch back and forth.\nAs stated before, the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy.  But, starting with about the fourth mission, they start to get REALLY tough, with multitudes of TIE fighters, missile turrets, and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down.  Expect to die many times before mastering each mission.  Getting the gold medal on all 16 missions will definitely take a while.\nThe game has a lot of nice bonus features as well.  As you complete missions and earn higher medals, three bonus missions will appear, plus you will gain access to new ships, including the Millenium Falcon and a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor.  There is also a passcode screen, allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options, including a fourth bonus level and the Naboo Starfighter.  There is even a code to allow you to fly a Buick sedan against the Empire!  The codes themselves are pretty easy to get.  There are several sites on the Internet that have them.\nIt's easy to get immersed in the 3D environment of this game.  Many's the time I've found myself leaning over to the left or right as I put my X-Wing through a tight turn.  For those who like flight simulator-type games, I would say that this is the best FS game on the N64.  It's a bit dated now, what with the impending release of Rogue Squadron II for the GameCube, but for those N64 fans out there, this one is a must-have.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This game is great for Star Wars fans! There are eleven single missions, but there are three bonus missions too. The first is a race on Tatooine where you fly a T-16 Skyhopper in a race against three of your squadron mates! The second is the Death Star Trench Run which the developers, in my opinion over did, because the trence is HUGE and it has to many turns. The best bonus level is the Battle of Hoth. The graphics and music are superd just like every other Lucasarts and Factor Five 5 game! Their are also secret vehicles. You can pilot the Naboo Starfighter by using a secret code (go to Lucasarts website!) the Millunium Falcon and the TIE Interceptor can be earned when you complete the game by getting all the gold medals. It doesn't take long to beat this game if your good at games like this, but ot does offer a pretty good challenge. Now go join the Rebellion and vaporize those TIE Fighters.", "label": "good review"}

The levels, especially Washington DC, is a small open level, which is no fun.  The North Pole is annoying, and I hate the boring London level.

You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race).

{"words": "If you don't read anything else:\n\nIf you find this game at a yard sale for $1.00 - $5.00 or online, then go ahead and get it, but in my opinion there are much better snow boarding games out for the N64, like \"Big Mountain 2000,\" \"Twisted Edge,\" or even \"Snowboard Kids\" or \"Snowboard Kids 2.\"\n\nNow I know that this was the N64's first snowboarding game, so we shouldn't expect the Taj Mahal in video game form here, but having played the previous mentioned snowboarding games and then playing this, there are some things that I dislike about this game. First, landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill. First, you have to press the \"Z\" button when you land and secondly you can't move your control stick AT ALL when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen. That right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game. Also, if you want to try to play this game, I recommend plugging in an N64 controller that has a joystick that is still very firm. I started playing with my usually controller, where the joystick is a little loose and I was pretty bad. Plugged in another controller with a firm joystick, got INSTANTLY BETTER controlling my character in the game! Second, if you bump a wall you fall over. There are other snowboarding games on the N64 that do that, but here it seemed really prevalent. Third, the music in this game is really annoying sounding. I liked the title track, but after that I was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again! I would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here. Fourth, I noticed that \"PRETTY MUCH\" the only way of winning a race against the computer player, was to take a short cut hidden in each course. Sure you could try to out board them, but if you mess up 2 or 3 times (hit a wall or wall over) FORGET WINNING!!! Fifth, when you enter the competition events, YOU ONLY GET SO MANY CONTINUES and let's say you are playing on easy (Where there are 4 tracks) and you want to quit the 3rd race because you know you are going to lose and don't want to waste a continue. So you go to select \"Restart\" from the pause menu. YOU ARE BACK ON THE FIRST COURSE AND HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING OVER AGAIN!!! AGGH!!! Sixth, I did some of the time attack modes, I believe that's the right name for it. I am not positive right now.) Anyway, you have to board through certain goals (They look like a traditional marathon finish line) and I am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me, that I had no chance of getting on from where I was and time ran out and I lost! WHY WOULD THEY PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE GAME!!! Put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them. Not up on a cliff, that I could of went up on, 8 seconds ago, but now I am stuck!!!\n\nI loved the look of this game! That's why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game. I tried very hard to like this game, but I still couldn't bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws. If you can overlook them, and you have the taste for snowboarding games you should be able to enjoy this game. Happy playing and thanks for reading! Merry Christmas and best wishes for 2010 and beyond!!!", "label": "bad review"}

This is a more realistic snowboarding game, so there are very realistic colors; unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors. 1080 features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated. Anyways, the graphics I remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow. I liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy. For that, this game got what it got in this category.\n\nSound: 9/10. Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice, there's a different noise. There is a different sound for everything, which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game.\n\nControl: 8/10. Very, very realistic and solid, but It's frustrating for that reason. it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land, which can be frustrating for little kids. There is also damage; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race.\n\nFun: 8.5/10.

Another reason is the outstanding multiplayer coordination. I bought this as soon as I played it at a friend's house. You unfortunatley play with only 2 players at a time, but it is still fun to play your friend head to head.  There are 6 courses, and under single player you can also do half pipe and air make. There are 5 characters that you can use to race, and more of which you can unlock. since there are only 60 head to head course combinations, there are other things you can do, like trick or time attacks.\n  This can take a bit to get used to, as it can be boring for the single player.

The stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours.  However, it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points.

But even after you've unlocked all the courses, it's still fun to play against your friends in the 2 Person VS mode, or doing tricks in the half pipe.\nI think that anyone who has a N64 should add this game to their collection, without a doubt... it's a solid game, and you won't regret it.", "label": "good review"}

Although you can't go beyond 1080 degree turns, there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game.\n1080 also includes a Training mode, which includes two different sections, the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls. When you begin, you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks, or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over. When you finish, you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit.\n1080 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game.\nOverall, 1080 is probably the best snowboarding game around, without any doubt. Would be definitely worth buying.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I'll preface this by saying yes I have played through FFVII on the playstation when it first came out. I've probably played through it at least a dozen times as I just enjoy the story, how it unfolds, the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories together.\n\nPrior to this game, I was mostly into sports/FPS type games. An RPG (heck I didn't even know what that meant at the time) game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that I wanted. A friend of mine where I was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game. Indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it, the more I got interested in it.\n\nThen came release day. I still wasn't sold on it but after leaving work I figured... what the hell. Drove 45 minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at EBGames. Soon as I entered he was like \"Did you preorder this!!\". I told him no and that I wasn't really interested in RPG's as they always sound boring and I'd lose interest quick and waste my money. He showed me a quick demo and I admit, it got me thinking as to \"I wonder what happens after this...\". I finally said sure. He hooked me up with the strategy guide, free tshirt and the 3 disc game... 3 DISCS!! When I cracked open the case and saw 3 discs... I knew this would be an epic, legendary tale. I just didn't know how epic.\n\nI won't go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know who/what they are. But the story... wow. I could not have been more hooked. At first it started off a little slow, mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going. After the 2nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet Aeris... it all changes. The direction, tone and emotion starts running higher. Battles get more intense. You really get the feel that something big, much bigger than even all these characters is building up. It all seems to point to Shinra, but even as you infiltrate it, something is even more disturbing. JENOVA. Soon as I saw that short cutscene with Cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber.. my jaw dropped. I wanted to know what it is, where it came from, what they are using it for etc etc etc. But thats what set this game apart. The more answers you get, the more questions were raised than before.\n\nThe world is huge, lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines. I spent alot of time raising the Chocobos and racing them to get the Gold Choco so I can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materia.\n\nMateria System: One of the best magic systems I have encountered to date. While you won't use all the materia you buy/find. Its the reward of seeing that glowing green/blue/red/yellow/purple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is. Summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made. Knights of the Round was very long to summon, but the damage and wait is well worth it.\n\nCharacters: Some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds. I think the first time I really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when I first went into Shinra Mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the Shinra research was stored regarding JENOVA, Sephiroth and the experiments. The characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations. Making you want to keep going and see whats around the next corner.\n\nIn conclusion, for us long-timers here this game never gets old. For the newcomers, get ready to experience something extraordinary. To quote the back of the Playstation case.. \"What erupts goes beyond imagintion\".", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This Final Fantasy 7 is one of the most influenced games of all time. The fan bases for this one game blows out all FF fan base out of the water. Never has any other FF game seen such an influenced with multiple related games/story characters found in different games. Multiple Movies. Toys, cards, etc based on this game.  Why was that all necessary for this one game?\n\nIt's just that DAMN AWESOME! This game has everything! Story, characters, battle system, music, humor and more! If it didn't why else did this game influenced so many other things that followed it after? Because it was just damn awesome!\n\nYou can play this game over and over before getting tried of it, but you will keep it in your hearts forever. The amazing game play, the amazing characters, and amazing graphics. (Back in those days.)\n\nThey just can't make anything that even comes close to what they did back then.

{"words": "This game is very fun to play, but be warned off by this review from me!  It has the highly severe computer worm in its installation cds that Symantec's Norton web site refers to as: \"IRC W32 Tibick Activity\".  Also the XP update for it also has a computer worm in it!\nTo check out the details off what it does to infected computer systems go to: [...]\nThat page at Norton doesn't specifically refer to \"Final Fantasy VII\", but for those that want to know for sure that what I'm stating is correct you can use the shorter web site address at Norton by using the web address of: [...]\nIn the web page that pops up into view; enter: \"Final Fantasy VII\"  into the search box on that page and hit the enter key on your keyboard.  A page with three options will comeup.  The top one is about the worm in the FF VII installation cds.  The next one is about the XP 1.5 version upgrade, and that has an additional worm in it.  The final option refers to a worm that infects FF XI & FF XII.  That worm is even more dangerous than even the one on the FF VII installation cds.  Thast one will automatically go to the computer's  email section and send ZIP versions of itself to every contact listed there.  Also all three worms will every time the computer is turned on check for a specific website to get upgraded versions of itself.\nMy advise though Norton doesn't state it; is to destroy every copy of the PC version of \"Final Fantasy VII\" that you have to prevent infecting the computers in the world.\nIn the file about \"IRC W32 Tibick Activity\" the Norton people mention how to completely remove the computer worm from infected computer systems.  That process can take a while though as that worm infects several other programs on the computer as well.  Norton lists all the programs that it infects as well.\nI myself have two copies of FF VII and even a copy of the cds I made as well.  I'm going to destroy those cds as well to follow my own advise.  Those people sure did a very mean stunt to the makers of Final Fantasy VII in ruining possibly the best rpg game they ever made!!!  Personally I think those people at the least should be sent to a federal prision<sp> for the rest of their lives!!! grrr!!!", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "This game is fantastic, and you won't be able to put it down for a long long time.  I have over 120+ hours played on my game save.  Final Fantasy VII Platinum Edition features a revamped old soundtrack...that I find 2x better than the PSone version's soundtrack.  Although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls, after playing for a while, you'll wonder how you would have done it any other way.  The on-screen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship, you'll have a hard time typing in key combos.  Materia allows you to use different magics on different characters, allowing for different characters to use Summons, Magic, and Cure.  My tip: don't give up solely because of the controls---this game is FANTASTIC and although I found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into, the PC version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it.  FF7 is by far the best game I have ever played, and you do not want to miss out on this adventure.  My only tip: don't save over the same file, especially before you enter the Northern Crater--you won't be able to exit it if you do.\n\nReplayability: ***** (Tons of extra caves, quests, missions, mini-games to find, extra materia, weapons, limit-breaks, and bosses to fight well after the game is over.)\n\nGameplay: ***** (Amazing boss fights, you will be on the edge of your seat during battles, incredibly fun)\n\nStory: ***** (The plot twists, the depth in the story, the emotions...its AMAZING)\n\nGraphics: ***** (You can view on a big resolution, better textures and stuff.  More crisp than the PSone version)\n\nControls: **** (Takes a while to get used to, you won't want to try another control setup once you do)\n\nSound: ***** (Sound effects are recycled from the PSone game, BUT, the music was totally redone, and that is one of the biggest parts of this game)\n\nAddictiveness: ***** (I stopped playing my other games for almost 4 months when I got into this game)\n\nThe best part of this game is that it is so easy to pick up and play.  The Ruby and Emerald Weapons provide you with more challenge than the last boss of the game.  Raising chocobos and minigames at the Golden Saucer couldn't be more fun, and this remains the only game besides World of Warcraft that I haven't uninstalled from my computer.  Final Fantasy VII is a keeper, and don't be discouraged by the prices on Amazon, by the time you're done with the game, you will believe it to be the best $50 you have spent on a game.  I would know, because I said the same thing.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "An interesting aspect of the Final Fantasy series was that all of the games were essentially an experiment. The first game was the ultimate experiment: will this game succeed or will Square go under? But each game was a stage in development.\n\nFF- Choosing party, and character sprites in battle\n\n(Before that, the Dragon Warrior games had battle head-on)\n\nFFII- wound-developable characters\n\n(Romancing SaGa later employed this, when you survive near death your hp goes up, when you fight alot attack goes up, etc.)\n\nFF3J- simple job system (completely changes characters, no permanent skills)\n\nFF4- Changing characters (a dark knight becomes a paladin)\n\nFFV- Advanced job system (level up with one of the non-command skills to default class, and you permanently learn it, for instance the run skill you can learn from the thief, and then de-equip it)\n\nFFVI- basic GF system (mainly just boosts skills)\n\nFF7- basic weapon system\n\nFF8- GF system\n\nFF9- I heard it had some sort of advanced weapon system where different weapons learn different magic, never bought the game\n\nLikewise, the plot in each was experimental. They fiddled around with the crystal concept in FF1, FF3J, FF4, FFV.  They had ruthless kings, dark overlords, and the occasional malicious squid. But the most intense game I have played so far was Final Fantasy 7. Why? Well, when halfway through the game your character doesn't even know who he is anymore, it is pretty interesting.  Not to mention you have combos to build, chocobos to raise and race (never was good at this), and some pretty weird items to collect (I mean honestly, what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wear).", "label": "good review"}

One of these members is a man named Cloud, a 21 year old guy who was in a orginazation called Soldier, which is the army of Shinra. Possibly the greatest plot and climax I've ever seen. Great battles, they proved to be a challenge. Cloud, Sid, and Red 13 are my favorite charecters. Also some of the best movies in a game that i've seen for a long time.
