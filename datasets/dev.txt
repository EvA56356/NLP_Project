Well the version I downloaded from AMazon was so quiet it could barely be heard played over my computer speakers and when played on my X7/Sennheiser portable music set up I thought I'd missed it.

As per the songfacts website, \"Rebel Yell\" is basically about a one night stand that is very pleasurable that the lover ends up expressing that they want more.

Billy Idol really puts alot of his spirit into the song in such an excellent fashion that it is almost like he is telling a very entertaining story that he is simultaneously singing. I admit that I first heard this song when I was a teenager, and I currently still love listening to this song. The guitar riffs and his fantastic singing blend well together with this song to make it a musical track that is fun to listen to multiple times in a row. \"Rebel Yell\" is also another song to put in a love/lust playlist and/or 80's classic song playlist", "label": "good review"}

When the opportunity to do a right after too many wrongs presents itself Rye grabs it and hires Tory, a small town cook with chef qualities.  Tory is struggling to make any ends meet so the offer to be Ryes personal tour cook is an offer she grabs at with both pancake flipping hands.\n\nTory cooks for the pleasure of it and has a magic touch when creating her culinary masterpieces which please Rye on every level.

{"words": "LOVED THIS BOOK!  I had country music playing softly in the background while I devoured each and every page of \"Country Heaven\" by Ava Miles.  This was a contemporary romance with characters that you couldn't help but love.\n\nCountry singer, Rye Crenshaw, sneaks away to enjoy some comforting diner food, but ends up being comforted by the cook.  Not at first!  She was not into country music or country cowboys.  And he was not into petite, intelligent women.  Let me tell you... there were lots of tingles in this book!  The romance grew and developed, and then it crashed and burned, and came back again full force.  THIS is what romance is all about!\n\nThis book was more than just a romance novel.  It delved into family.  Neither Tory nor Rye had family to start with.  Tory's family had all died and Rye had chosen to leave his family.  When the time came to make amends and rebuild the kinship, Tory helped Rye see what was truly important.\n\nIf you want a Happily-Ever-After that will have you yanking tissues out of the box, one right after the next, I heartily recommend this book to you.\n\nI am definitely going to look for more books by this author.  Her writing flowed with characters that will stay in your heart long after you read the last page.  This one positively deserves 5 stars!", "label": "good review"}

However, it was also rather fantastic that Tory becomes so important to everyone in his family with one hold out in just a few days. But hey, this is a fantasy country romance, so we can all deal with that.\n\nAs others have pointed out, it was disappointing that the major issue of the identity of the traitor was not revealed in the conclusion of the book, but is held as a promise for the next installment. Since I personally found Tammy less than appealing and her metamorphosis contrived, I will not be continuing with the series and it counted against giving this full stars. Although this was enjoyable for a light read and relatively well written, a little more depth would have been appreciated\n\nI will, however, check out the cooking book. It will save me time trying to get to the recipes that caught my attention.

{"words": "4-4.5 stars\n\nThis was a really good story! I fell in love with Tory and Rye and their story was surprisingly good and a freebie to boot (and it's still free on Amazon).\n\nTory is a cook who's working her way through school. She's currently finishing up her dissertation for a doctorate in Anthropology. She lost her parents due to a car wreck at an early age and was raised by her grandparents. Tory's grandmother taught her how to cook but made her promise (on her deathbed) that she'd get an education (hence the doctorate). Tory's grandfather just died recently, leaving her on her own and with a lot of medical bills to deal with.\n\nRye is a Country star. He grew up in a blue blood southern family and got disowned when he left law school to pursue his dreams of singing country for a living. Rye is a bad boy and tends to party and sleep around.\n\nThe story begins with Rye being on tour and looking for a good meal late at night after he finishes with a show. He lost his last cook and found great reviews for a local diner so he shows up to get a meal. He finds that the food is awesome and that the cook is having money problems so he offers her (Tory) a position as his tour cook for an amount of money that will really help ease some of her pressing bills. Tory doesn't listen to country so she's not really a fan of Rye's. She's not sure if she really wants to be his tour cook but takes a chance since she could really use the money and has the summer off of school anyways. Since Rye lost his last cook after some sleeping around made her get pissed and leave, Rye makes it a condition of Tory's employment that she can't sleep with anyone on tour. Tory goes along with this because she's not the sort to sleep around and doesn't really see it as a possible issue.\n\nWhen things start up, Rye and Tory have some conflicts between them due to some publicity/tabloid stories (both good and bad) that cause some difficulties. Before too long though, Rye and Tory become friends, finding that they like chatting and having each other as company. When Rye's family issue become more pressing, he turns to Tory for support and this pushes them closer. Rye hasn't seen himself as having anything to offer a woman and therefor can't see himself getting seriously involved or married to a woman and Tory sees his reluctance in this area clearly. She's not willing to get her heart broken but things end up pushing them together and eventually they both let themselves go there. Things aren't perfect after that though and both external and internal issues end up causing drama that pulls them apart. Things look pretty bad for a while but Rye grows as a person and eventually realizes he can't live without Tory. He makes a great effort to get her back and although Tory was pretty positive things were done between them, she can't help but be touched by his actions and they're able to come back together in a very sweet HEA.\n\nI was very pleased with this story. I really liked both Tory and Rye. Tory was sweet and smart with a backbone as well. I liked that although she was sweet, that sweetness didn't come across as weak. Rye had his issues but the story showed enough of him under the bluster that you could see he was really a great guy underneath, he just had to see it for himself to realize he had something to offer the right woman. I also really liked his relatives (except his mother), especially his niece and nephew. Overall, this was a really good story with some very likable characters I'd recommend it (especially since it's a freebie). :D", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Country Heaven is book 1 in the Dare River series by Ava Miles. I simply loved this book.  It is adventurous, has a mystery, loads of romance, and lots of family interaction and forgiveness.\nRye Crenshaw has cut ties with his family, except for his little sister, Amelia Ann. Now his sister, Tammy, has come to him on his tour to ask him to come home as his Father, who had a heart attack, wants to talk to him.  Although he really sees no use, he heads home but takes his chef, Tory home with him.  He doesnt need her as a chef as much as a friend to help him get through with this visit.  He also doesnt want any publicity over this visit.\nWhen they arrive at Hollinswood, they find Ryes Mother has not relented one bit in her hostility towards Rye.  After all, he refused his place in the family law firm, and chose to embarrass them with his lifestyle.  Thankfully, he had changed his name from Hollins to Crenshaw, his grandfathers name. However, his Father is asking for reconciliation.  He shows Rye that he has all of Ryes CDs and tells Rye that he is very proud of him but ashamed of his own behavior towards Rye.  Ryes Mother lets them out after his talk with his Father.  He is to stay in the guesthouse.  Since this was where his grandfather stayed, Rye is not insulted as his Mother had intended.\nRye is soon reconciled with his sisters, Tammy to a lesser extent than Ameila Ann.  However, Tammy is more like their Mother than Ameila Ann is.  Tammy is married to a stuffy lawyer and has two perfect children and a perfectly spotless house.  She has conformed to the perfect wife and mother that her own Mother did.  However, she does what is expected and greets Rye and Tory nicely.  Tory and Rye quickly see that Annabelle and Rory are not happy but are definitely perfect children.  Tammy and the kids soon come around, Annabelle more than the rest.  Rory is especially standoffish to everyone.  Amelia Ann asks Rye for help talking to her Father about going to Vanderbilt and becoming a lawyer. She does not want to follow in Tammys steps and be a society wife.\nHamilton Hollins asks his son to run an errand for him.  While Rye is doing that, he sets out to visit Tory.  They get along great and are talking when Rye comes  home, his errand having been completed.  Tammy soon angrily follows.  She is angry at Rye for going to her husbands office and punching him.  When she turns to her Father for backup, she finds it was he who sent Rye to confront Sterling about his cheating on Tammy and sending a message that he is to stop now.  What they don't know is they have made Tammys situation much harder since Sterling also hits Tammy.  They adjourn to the main house for dinner and afterwards, Sterling appears having been invited by their Mother.  Hamilton tells Sterling he is not welcome here; but that they need to talk.  Tammy, Hamilton, Rye, and Sterling adjourn to the study.  Here, after being arrogant and saying some things about Tammy, Sterling says he will divorce Tammy for a million dollars.  Rye offers the money, Hamilton draws up the divorce papers as well as papers for complete custody of the children and Sterling who really didn't expect his price to be met, eagerly signs the papers.  Tammy is stunned but happy.\nWhen Rye returns to his tour, he and Tory continue their affair and plans are made for Tammy and her kids to move into Ryes home at Dare River.  Then the tabloids publish the terms of Tammys divorce and Ryes hand in it.  Tammy is horrified and Rye is angry and wants to know who talked.  Several hands point to Tory and Rye accuses her.  She claims her innocence and leaves for home as planned.  She is determined to finish her doctorial study.  This was the second time he accuses her of letting information about him slip and it will be the last time.  She won't be there to get any information.\nWho let the information out?  What will that do to Tammys divorce?  Will Amelia Ann be allowed to go to Vanderbilt or will Mothers plan for her win?  What does Torys leaving do to Rye and his career?  Will Rory come out of his shell?\nThere is so much more going on in the lives of Rye, Tory, Tammy, Ameila Ann, and Ryes parents.  I loved how complicated the plot of this seemingly innocent romance became.  Ava Miles has a talent for complicating their lives yet still seeing the end.  Her use of language is spectacular.  Another good thing is that Country Heaven  is on Kindle Unlimited and its sequel in only $0.99.  I can hardly wait to start the next book.

{"words": "When I began reading the first Dare River novel, I wasn't sure what to expect from the character of country music star, Rye Crenshaw. From his appearances in previous Miles' novels, I knew he was a good ol' boy who loved good food, but beyond that not much more. Without a doubt, I was curious and had a feeling that soon he'd be having his own story, but hadn't anticipated a spinoff series.\n\nQuite cleverly, Miles had placed his Nashville home along the Dare River, so what could be a more effective brand tie-in than Dare Valley and Dare River. However, reading Country Heaven, I wasn't thinking of branding or cute names, but was enjoying the freedom that Miles was having in telling the story of Rye and Tory Simmons, the gem of a cook he found in a roadside diner.\n\nRemember, I mentioned he loved to eat. Well, once initial prickliness was set aside and he experienced Tori's cooking, this graduate student soon had a job as his personal chef. Tori is a strong, salt-of-the-earth character who dispenses wisdom and love with every meal she prepares. Like her grandmother, whose recipes she wants to use to turn into a book, Tori's warmth and kindness is clearly evident. I love her take-no-prisoners attitude with Rye when she walks into him relaxing - along with a groupie - and when she refuses to wear the see-through apron that his former cook/mistress had left behind.\n\nIt was evident that there was romance to be dished up between Rye and Tori, but the journey to that point is what makes this book so fun to read - along with Tori's recipes that Miles includes. Before I even finished the book, I was planning what meals to recreate. (I guess I was not alone in this as Miles has published a stand-alone cookbook, see my review.)\n\nIn addition to the romance, Country Heaven also focuses on family - and what family really means.\n\nOnce again, I cried and laughed as I read Miles' story, but when I turned the last page a bit of happiness stayed with me. Yes, that's the true magic of reading an Ava Miles book, she shares her happiness with her readers and it's quite a wonderful gift to receive.\n\n(I received an eARC from the publisher through Netgalley for use in this review.)", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Well one thing is for sure, don't read this if you are hungry. *smiley face* Rye walks into a diner and leaves with the cook. Literally. She needs the money and he needs home cooking. It works right? Well..maybe not so much.\n\nYou have heard before I am sure. A way to a mans heart is through his stomach. What Rye needs is a swift kick in the butt and some real honest to goodness truth laid out. Tory gives him just that. With a no nonsense attitude and a real down home love of food. Tory takes care of him the only way she really knows how. She never dreamed it would lead to more.\n\nWith bad press and a visit home to check on his ailing father Rye and Tory discover that what they share is more than a love of food, but a connection that is more than surface or sexual chemistry. Its real. Eventually, bad choices on Ryes part and unwillingness to trust drives them apart. Can he fix this? Will Tory let him? Well you're gonna have to read to find out.\n\n4 down home stars for Counrty Heaven\n\nT~\n\nOh and the best part? Ava Miles gives you all the mouth watering recipes at the end of each chapter!! That is worth the read alone!\n\n*Given by the publisher via Netgalley", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "My son (11) and I have just received the book, so this is a \"first impressions\" review. We went right ahead and built \"The Snatcher\" which is a beautiful robot and also teaches how to perform two actions with a one motor.\n\nAppearance:  browsing through the book I was very pleased by its overall graphic quality, which is probably the best of all the NXT books we own. The graphics are grayscale, nevertheless they are outstanding, both in layout, scale and resolution. No more magnifying glass required to build the models! The resulting building instructions are very similar and follow the same conventions as real Lego building instructions. In fact, if they were published in color, I could not tell the difference from original Lego instructions, as they come in any Lego original set. The programming is explained block-by-block, also taking advantage of the print quality, as do the diagrams and of course the text.\n\nContent: I wished we had this book when we started building NXT robots with my son a couple of years ago. It starts from the very basic and progresses to the more advanced topics. It engages the reader to go beyond the instructions of the models with \"discoveries\". This is a great learning method.\n\nConclusion: This book will greatly enhance the experience of any NXT 2.0 buyer. It goes way beyond the models that come \"bundled\" with the set. It will keep youngsters glued to the set, learning and having fun. I think any prospective NXT 2.0 set purchaser would do very well in purchasing the book together with the set. Or perhaps Lego should bundle the book with the set!\n\nWhen we build more models of the book, I will review it further.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "From his infectious enthusiasm for the Mindstorms NXT System it might be easy to guess that Laurens Valk was introduced to Lego Robotics at age 13 just five short years ago. But, from the careful logical pedagogy of this book and his interesting approach mixing successively more advanced robots intermixed with a clearly arranged taxonomy of parts, programming tools and motor/drive train and sensor categorization, I would have imagined that this book was written by an excellent teacher with many years of experience bringing engineering concepts to youthful learners.  Not only does the book offer a clear top-down beginning to end approach to both the NXT Parts Architecture and NXT-G Programming Language while combining this end-to-end approach with interesting projects of increasing difficulty, but he stimulates the reader with building and programming challenges to increase their skill at independent thought in robot building and programming.  Just how far and how thoughtfully Laurens' teaching approach goes is indicated by by his unique system of flowcharting/state diagrams which both provides the logical decisions involved in programming this system with a graphical correspondence to the NXT-G Programming language.\n\nI cannot recommend this book highly enough as an aid to using the Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0 robotics system, and bringing a\nnew generation of roboticists and engineers to a deep and intuitive understanding these sciences.  This handbook should be included in every Mindstorms NXT Set to insure that the recipient will learn, absorb and extend the concepts which this powerful educational system can teach.\n\n--Ira Laefsky\nMSE/MBA I.T.

The book focuses on the concepts, not how to write a \"Hello, World\" program in any particular programming language. That's a good thing. As she moves on into specific languages, it makes it easier to learn the specific syntax of a language if you already have an understanding of the nature of strings, arrays, loops, logical arguments, files, etc.\n\nNot wanting to wait 2 days for the paperback book to arrive, I also rented the e-book on Kno.com for $20.

The book goes over many concepts that are required to know before you can program, but the actual programming involved in the book is very sparse.  When the book uses programming examples, they are just short snippets showing code from a variety of different programming languages.  It gives you an idea of how something would be programmed, but if you actually wanted to write programs, you wouldn't be able to after reading just this book.\n\nIf you want an overview of programming and how it works in very simplified terms, this is the book to get.  Due to the title being \"Computer Programming for Teens\" though, this book led me to believe that it was going to actually teach programming in itself.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "I am a Ph. D. in education and have been looking for a good computer programming book for kids.  Based on all my years of experience with how students learn, I wanted a book that would teach programming concepts without making huge leaps from one concept to another.  I had bought another \"basic\" programming book before and chapters 1-4 were great and then in chapter 5, the leap was huge and any child trying to learn from it would get lost!  This book uses appropriate teaching strategies to help children understand the concepts in programming.  It links each concept to a real world example that the student can relate to (this is very important in the learning process.)  For example, when explaining the differences in programming syntax among languages in chapter 1 - a basic concept, it shows the parallel between that and the different syntax in 4 different spoken languages.  When teaching the idea of binary, it explains it as open and closed roads.  For each concept, there is a real world link which is the best way for children to learn.  The book provides codes from different languages although seems to use C++ mostly, however, the purpose of the book is not to teach syntax but concepts in programming.  It is the perfect book for someone to read before they start to code.  It allows them to learn about different data types, strings, arrays, functions, loops, recursion, etc.  Although code is given to demonstrate, the idea is to teach the purpose of these data structures.  The best approach would be to go through this book first and then pick up a book that actually has you start working with actual code and writing programs.  Although this book says Computer Programming for Teens, it could be used for any age student with enough maturity to and interest to begin learning programming.  Many kids are able to start learning these ideas much earlier than the \"teen\" years.", "label": "good review"}

I enjoy the way this author draws you into a story, forcing you to turn just one more page to find out what happens next.\n\nDisliked:\n\nAgain, hard to tell without spoilers, so I will just say that the author used a particular type of formatting that kind of gave away the 'twist' way too early.\n\nOverall:\n\nA terrific, fast read\n\nLength: Novella\n\nRating: R for violence, language, and sexual references", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "A couple of reviews I read of this book said that it would be useful for business travelers.  WRONG.  First, the vocabulary in this book contains very little that would be of use to travelers for either business or pleasure -- who typically don't need to know words for things like \"dog,\" or \"cat,\" kitchen appliances, bedroom furniture, or articles of clothing.  Second, the vocabulary in general is extremely basic.  Things like colors and numbers, while important, are hardly worth buying a book for.  Anyone who took as little as a year of French in school, even if that was 20 years ago, will likely be beyond the grade level offered here.  Finally, the design is cartoonish -- more like a child's coloring book than something that would appeal to most adults.  I admit that I found the stickers kind of cute and enjoyed pasting them around the house in anticipation of my upcoming trip to Paris, but their value in refreshing my college French -- let alone teaching me anything new that might be useful -- was extremely minimal.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "I am an artist and needs lots of true daylight lighting when I work. This item allows me to get that lighting when traveling and when I am in areas without good task lighting. Small and easy to pack or carry in a shoulder bag. It stands upright sitting its clip style base. The neck is very adjustable but if not clipped to weighted item and you tilt neck too far over either way it will fall over. The batteries in base compartment last a fair amount of time but gets costly to keep replacing when using for numerous hours. I purchased the AC plugin accessory additionally so I can work steadily using the wall plugin for continually powered lighting. Gave it 4 stars because of expense of batteries and expense of buying the electric plugin accessory. In closing however, I highly recommend this product to anyone needing true bright white light that is portable.", "label": "good review"}

I can make a choice, and my choice is to let the birthday person splurge on whatever tickles their fancy. Hence, the gift card. I'm a practical person myself, but I'd probaly loose my mind if I recieved a vacuum or sink mats for my bd.

The Amazon card makes a great gift & the bonus tin is \"icing on the cake\". ;)  The bonus tin is about 4\" x 4.5\" & one of the cutest ways to give a gift card as a gift. The inside has a removable black lining insert to hold the gift card. The back has a clear window, & says \"Amazon gift cards\" in very small print.  The tin is reusable & can be used to hold other small items or change. Very nice that Amazon offers this adorable tin with their gift cards.\n\nAmazon gift cards make a great gift because the selection of products offered on this website is Huge!  Unlike giving a gift card to a specific store, restaurant, or for a specific item (i.e. movie tickets, waterparks, etc), an Amazon gift card can be used for whatever the receiver wants. That's a huge perk in gift giving. Other recommendations: Buy it to have on hand as a gift. You never know when you'll be invited to a party or have an event come up where you'll need a quick gift.  No more running around store to store. You'll have this gift on hand.  Another idea- purchase it for yourself. Maybe you know you will want to buy something later in the year.

Stood there for 30 minutes and called a few different customer service numbers to see why it wouldn't work, yada yada yada, waste of time and energy.

{"words": "When these cookies were offered to me, I decided my mom needed them for a nice surprise during a stressful and busy time.\n\nI ordered the cookies on a Friday afternoon, December 4th 2015, and they arrived in the Los Angeles area on Wednesday December 9, 2015, having shipped on Monday. The box arrived well packed so that the tin, and it's cookies, were not damaged en route. Had these cookies been for me, I would not have minded a little bouncing around, dented tin and broken cookies, but not as a surprise for Mom that needed a good surprise. I feel confident from that experience that you can feel assured they will arrive fresh and intact with less potential to be a gift you have to apologize for.\n\nMy mom is not a baker but she has a sweet tooth and very much enjoys cookies, like most of us. She was much pleased with the variety, while her favorite was the classic American chocolate chip cookies, she ate them all and did not feel the need, or want, to share with anyone. The cookeis are soft with some chew without being cakey or chemically soft that you find in packaged grocery store \"soft\" batches of cookies.\n\nThe cookies don't have a pronounced buttery flavor, as they are made without dairy with palm, soy and olive oil, but they do taste rich without a greasy shortening taste. I love real butter but this is a close second, mainly just because I felt I should check it out food the foodie factor, the palm and olive oil jazzing it up over standard formulations of soy and/or cottonseed oils most typically seen. The palm oil is great for stability in hot climates, so this will be a plus for shipping in hot weather.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this order, and it went smoothly, I can recommend ordering from this experience, and I likely will, as Mom has requested more, \"If you get the chance.\" Things to keep in mind, the 1lb size is best for one or two people, an office, group or family would do best with a larger size to make sure that everyone has a chance to enjoy them.\n\nDavid's cookies provided me with a coupon to try these at a promotional price so that I could share my experience and opinion with you (and Mom's.)", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I am not a cheese expert nor do I claim to be one so this kind of cheese is new to me.  If you are not used to this kind of cheese you might have the same reaction I did and I guess since I am usually getting cheese that's found in the supermarket (like slices of Kraft cheese or a block of cheese) I found this cheese to be an acquired taste.  At 1st I thought the cheese was awful but than I thought about it and the main reason I thought that was since I am not used to the taste it might not be pleasing at 1st.  So I gave it a chance and over a few minutes I had found it to be great tasting and I wanted more and its the same way when someone eats it with me.  Even though when I let someone else taste this cheese they usually have the same reaction I had when I ate it the 1st time and I understand why, so I explain why it probably doesn't cater to their taste.  I have found its taste is still not for everyone so that's why I figure its more acquired if you are used to something else.  I have found any of the cheeses that came to be relatively strong tasting and always leaveing an aftertaste and that is not always a bad thing.  It was a nice way to taste the way different cheeses from different places vary.  Now that I have the taste for gourmet cheese and its grown on me quite a bit I don't know if I can go back to normal supermarket cheese anymore.", "label": "good review"}

I am currently on my second order, and I will definitely reorder this again.\n\nUPDATE: I have found that this cheese makes a great grating or shredded cheese in lieu of sharp cheddar.

My only real complaint is that the gift message was printed in small font at the bottom of the packing slip; not a single one of our kids noticed it, and we got quizzical messages from them asking if we were the ones who sent them the cookies.  A separate card or note taped to the top of the tin would have been a much better idea for the gift message.

{"words": "When these cookies were offered to me, I decided my mom needed them for a nice surprise during a stressful and busy time.\n\nI ordered the cookies on a Friday afternoon, December 4th 2015, and they arrived in the Los Angeles area on Wednesday December 9, 2015, having shipped on Monday. The box arrived well packed so that the tin, and it's cookies, were not damaged en route. Had these cookies been for me, I would not have minded a little bouncing around, dented tin and broken cookies, but not as a surprise for Mom that needed a good surprise. I feel confident from that experience that you can feel assured they will arrive fresh and intact with less potential to be a gift you have to apologize for.\n\nMy mom is not a baker but she has a sweet tooth and very much enjoys cookies, like most of us. She was much pleased with the variety, while her favorite was the classic American chocolate chip cookies, she ate them all and did not feel the need, or want, to share with anyone. The cookeis are soft with some chew without being cakey or chemically soft that you find in packaged grocery store \"soft\" batches of cookies.\n\nThe cookies don't have a pronounced buttery flavor, as they are made without dairy with palm, soy and olive oil, but they do taste rich without a greasy shortening taste. I love real butter but this is a close second, mainly just because I felt I should check it out food the foodie factor, the palm and olive oil jazzing it up over standard formulations of soy and/or cottonseed oils most typically seen. The palm oil is great for stability in hot climates, so this will be a plus for shipping in hot weather.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this order, and it went smoothly, I can recommend ordering from this experience, and I likely will, as Mom has requested more, \"If you get the chance.\" Things to keep in mind, the 1lb size is best for one or two people, an office, group or family would do best with a larger size to make sure that everyone has a chance to enjoy them.\n\nDavid's cookies provided me with a coupon to try these at a promotional price so that I could share my experience and opinion with you (and Mom's.)", "label": "good review"}

The bulb was still bright on the inside. Never flickers and takes only a trickle of electricity so I just leave them on. I always buy 4 when I replace them, so I will have 2 extras to make a quick replacement and then order 2 more. They are not cheaply made, I am not sure what some reviewers are expecting for 17 or so dollars. One tip: when you mount it, take it to a local hardware store and ask them to size the proper size of type of screw (head diameter, length, and threads) and then buy 10 or so of these screws. Using the proper screws is very important for a nice tight fit against the bottom of the cabinet.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I don't necessarily like the quality or look of this light, but it's okay for getting the job done for the price and ease of installation.  I had a light similar to this one under my cabinet for about a year before I gave up on changing out batteries, which is why I was happy to find this particular light with a cord.  There is one small area in my kitchen where the track lighting doesn't hit properly, no matter how I adjust the lights, and it happens to be the counter space most suitable for food prep during stove-top cooking. This Lights of America light is cheap, convenient, bright enough to sufficiently light my counter, lightweight, and was easy to install with some heavy-duty velcro (yep, I used velcro...sophisticated, no...haha. But it'll certainly help when I have to change out the bulb because I could never get the light cover back on this thing without taking it down!).\n\nWith that said, keep in mind that you get what you pay for, and this light was cheap so I wasn't expecting greatness.  My older light that used batteries had thicker plastic casing that felt sturdier when being pressed into place, and it was thinner so that you couldn't see the light at all under the cabinet when it was turned off.  The plastic of the Lights of America light is flimsier, the light case/diffuser is a pain to keep attached to the unit while working with the light (actually, mine STILL isn't completely in place, but no one can tell because it's under the cabinet), and it's bulky-looking, despite the fact that my cabinets have a bottom edge that extends below the bottom shelf by about an inch, providing some cover of the light case but not all.  If you have a gorgeous updated kitchen, keep going with the updates and have a professional install solid lighting that is more stream-lined and blends with your decor.  But if you're like me and simply want extra light to see what you're prepping and aren't ashamed of your 1990s kitchen (hey, it works!), this light works just fine for a temporary solution that doesn't waste batteries like many other cheapo lights do.  One day I might spring for a more sophisticated set-up, but I'm content enough with how this light works for now.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "The 25 year old home that we recently moved into has ClosetMaid shelving in all the closets. I don't know for sure when they were installed, but I assume when the home was built. The shelving and support brackets are made of steel but the old brackets have plastic connectors between the front of the bracket and the shelf. These plastic connectors have gotten brittle over time and are breaking and we have been experiencing occasional shelving crashes when the plastic connector eventually breaks.  Fortunately, these brackets have been redesigned so that they don't require the plastic connectors. So, when an old connector breaks, you have to throw away the old connector and the old metal bracket and replace it with this new bracket. I have decided to purchase these brackets in bulk for a good price on Amazon, instead of paying twice as much when you buy a package of two at a big box store. I guarantee that you will eventually have to replace most of your old brackets. In order to prevent future catastrophic crashes, I plan to start replacing every other bracket which should make the installation stronger and safer.  I will do this first in the closets which have heaviest clothing - i.e. suits, coats, jackets and also where heavy items are stored on the shelf.", "label": "good review"}

I was mad. I had followed instructions exactly, and it seemed way too big to work. But, the packaging all swore it was the right thing, and I had some time to kill so I did a pressure trial. It did leak in the beginning stages and seemed to take a long time to get to pressure, but it eventually totally stopped leaking and did get up to the 15 lbs pressure I was aiming for. I let it depressurize normally. When I took the lid off, I was shocked and amazing to find that now the gasket fit perfectly. It works great and comes up to pressure much more quickly than it did the first time.\n\nI'm sad I didn't take a picture of the gasket before I did the test, but I did take one after, which I'm attaching.", "label": "good review"}

The canner sealed and built pressure, however, gasket stuck to the canner so the lid would not open without MUCH aggravation and pounding.  Thankfully it was EMPTY of food products for the test.\n\nAfter getting the lid to finally come off, I washed the gasket in soapy water, scrubbed the edges of the canner with steel wool where the gasket had stuck and 're-tested' the gasket WITH OUT OIL/LUBRICANT.  It sealed, built pressure and opened perfectly.\n\nAgain, DO NOT LUBRICATE the gasket with vegetable oil...in fact, I wouldn't lubricate it at all.  Just soak, wash and use.", "label": "good review"}

This fit very well, and once oiled with veggie oil and worked for 10 minutes, it fit very well. It looks to of the same design but a different material, which, since 1978, I am sure the material has been improved. I tucked the gasket into the rim and let it set for a couple days to normalize. Once it did, I found it to fit perfectly and when the lid was fastened, it was a near perfect match.\n\nI liked the way the new seal fits and functions properly, I would recommend this product to a family/friend to replace their old one.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Purchased this gasket through Amazon in 2011.  I have used the pressure canner several times since then.  When I used it this past weekend, the canner started to develop pressure and then the gasket appeared to have blown out.  Steam was escaping from the entire perimeter of the lid.  I had saved the old one, so I tried again using it instead.  Seemed to have worked just fine.\n\nOne tip for all you pressure canner users - do not use too much water in the canner, or make sure it's at a rapid boil BEFORE placing your jars in the canner.  The gasket takes a little time to seal before pressure will build up, as evidenced by the condensation dripping from the perimeter of the lid as steam initially escapes between the gasket, lid & canner.  Once enough pressure has built up, the gasket will eventually seal.  If you start with cool to lukewarm water, it will take a long time before enough steam is generated to effect a good seal.\n\nI suspect this gasket is not made to the exact same specifications as the original.  The canner I am using was inherited from my parents, so I have no idea how old it really is.  I suspect it's pre-1980 or older.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "Review updated 9Aug12\n\n1) Elmers \"Ultimate High Performance\" and \"Sticky Ass\" are also Polyurethane (PU) glues and (as far as I can tell) they're as good as Gorilla but less expensive. I have also used PL brand and can't tell any notable difference between the four. Have not used Sumo but I understand it sets up faster and as a result apparently has a much more limited shelf life (this is generally not a good thing - see item #3)\n\n2) Gorilla Glue (In my opinion) has thought out their bottle and cap design better than the competition.  While this seems like a minor thing, it really makes a BIG difference in not being messy or wasting glue (See #4)\n\n3) PU glues work differently - they foam up and expand in the presence of moisture and then harden.  This means you will need to think about where the glue comes out and how to keep it from making a mess.  Masking tape is your friend.\n\n4) PU glues have a limited shelf life and you probably don't need as much as you think. Due to the expansion (see #3) you use a LOT less than other types of glue. 4 oz should be MORE than enough for most people, 8 oz is a BIG bottle. I personally buy the 2 oz bottle unless I have a major project.  PU Glues suck moisture out of the air so unless you plan on using it up within a year or two, a LOT is going to go to waste. Don't ask me how I know this.\n\n5) PU Glue is FANTASTIC for lots of things but woodworking glues are still better for woodworking (see #7). They are stronger and you can't clean PU glues up with water the way you can even with the waterproof Titebond products. Also if you use biscuits you will have to moisten them separately to get them to swell.\n\n6) KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN AND ANIMALS! Although the glue itself is not toxic and is food safe once cured, it can kill your pets - like antifreeze it apparently tastes good to animals and will swell and harden inside the digestive tract creating a blockage. There is NO antidote and surgery is typically the only solution. There have been MANY cases - just search Google \"Dog Gorilla Glue.\" Wear gloves (rubber or vinyl) and use lots of wax paper and paper towels.\n\n7) Wood glues (Like Titebond II) are still better for wood to wood bonding.  Fine Woodworking did a test (Issue #192) and found Polyurethane glues to be about half as strong in this application.  Search \"HowStrongisYourGlue_FWW\" for the article.  One exception is if you're gluing oily exotics where I still prefer Epoxy - you can dial in your set time, clean up is about the same given the PU glue outflow.\n\nIf you have questions or comments, or if you have found this review helpful, please let me know!", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "Pros:\n-Really tough glue\n-More flexible than super glue\n-Waterproof\n-Works on many surfaces, metals, wood, ceramics, some plastics, etc. Best for wood applications.\n\nCons:\n-It expands, drips and produce tiny bubbles during the drying process.  Definitely not for repairing your Lladros or others applications that require hairline precision.\n-Glue is not clear but yellow. Very noticeable, not good if you really want a clean finish.\n-Make sure you really clean the tip of the bottle or it will be hard to open and use it the next time\n-Not cheap", "label": "bad review"}

We have used it to repair wooden chairs, fix a wooden medicine chest, glue soles back on to sneekers, fill cracks in a wall, and at least half a dozen other fixes in the past month.\n\nHere are my observations:\n\n* You must read the directions!\n* Surface needs to be damp for the glue to work\n* Use clamps when possible\n* It expands a *LOT*, use with caution or you might accidently glue your project to the table as it expands overnight! This happend to me :-)\n* This is strong glue and hard to get off once it is on a surface\n\nHighly recommended!", "label": "good review"}

I found the idea of an alpha and omega werewolf romance to be refreshing.  Yes, Laney is very much like an uke in a traditional yaoi story - but, I like yaoi.  He is a little effeminate, which may seem stereotypical, but there are men like this. Certainly not all gay men, or even all \"bottoms.\"  Yet, I rarely see readers griping about how so many romances have strong, handsome men either - why aren't they short and ugly to avoid being stereotypical? Because this is a fantasy romance not real life!  Laney's clumsiness is a little over the top, but his relationship with Dev is sweet and hot.  I would have liked the characters to be more developed, but this is a short story not a novel.

But he is also an eager puppy in bed and Dev likes him very much, so does it matter if he will spend his life to take off from troubles his mate?\n\nHere, like in the other books of J.L.

There are plenty of stories out there where you've got no idea until 6 pages from the end if the couple's even going to work or not, if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not.

Now while I don't mind that feeling when it comes to a plot line in general, I'm not so keen on it when it comes to the romance side of the plot so I read this one with mixed feelings in the beginning.  Glad I gave it a chance.  It still wouldn't be my favorite romance plot, but it turned out to be a fun story.\n\nDev drives out to a predetermined meeting place to meet the alpha of the pack in the area he plans on relocating too.  Just as he arrives, he witness the alpha and his betas punish the pack omega.  They are holding him down getting ready for a rape and Dev rescues the smaller man.\n\nWhen Dev gets the guy away, he discovers that the handsome man is his mate.  Laine and Dev accept the circumstances quickly.  Laine fills in the situation of what is going on with the bully alpha to Dev and Dev realizes that he will have to take the guy on if he wants to stay in the area.\n\nDev is part-owner in a construction company and his friends and part-owner join him.  The alpha steps up his aggression towards Laine forcing Dev's hand.  But even though that Laine is rather a klutz, he wants to help Dev take on the alpha and his betas.\n\nIt is a novella length story so the plot jumps in and gets going quickly.  The shifter world described here includes the idea that when the wolves find their mate, there is a bond made.  Sometimes I don't mind this, but it happened before I had a chance to really get to know the characters so I wasn't sold on this relationship until late in the story.  These two went at it hot and heavy before they barely got past learning each other's first names.  Now don't get me wrong, I learned to like both characters once I got to know them and I liked them together.  Laine's klutziness and his sweet temperament were cute and Dev's patience and gentleness with Laine was nice.  It was not hard picturing Dev as a pack alpha just because of the two sides to his personality.  He liked to be in charge, but he was also very protective.  And that reminds me of another thing about this particular shifter world, I liked the idea of the different designations for those involved in the pack.  We are all familiar with alphas, and get the idea of betas who are the alpha's lieutenants, but I thought the inclusion of the lesser used omega or peacemaking wolf role was pretty cool.\n\nIt was a light quick read that I can recommend to those who enjoy PNR that is more on the passionate side and isn't very dark.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "I'll preface this review by saying that I've read the other 3 books in the 'With or Without' series, and found them to be fun, light reads. I really enjoyed the diverse, well-drawn characters and the dramatic tension, two things which seem to be Langley's strengths.\n\nBut both are ENTIRELY missing from this short book. The characters are beyond shallow, and the plot is contrived and stupid. The characters meet, discover they're mates, and immediately fall in to bed together, despite the fact that one of them was very recently almost raped. What? Really? In her other books the characters go through a struggle, coming to terms with finding their mates and deciding how to deal, but there is no drama or development here whatsoever, just sex and attempts at humor that fall completely flat.\n\nTo be fair, I couldn't get to the end, so maybe it does get better. This is a really disappointing addition to what is otherwise a pretty great series. I'll still look forward to the next full-length release, but if you like the series, do yourself a favor and just skip this one.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "After reading the sample for this I was disappointed by the rest of it. It seemed like there would be more mature writing and a deeper plot. However, the plot is rather simple and most of the characters feel two dimensional and at times almost annoying. Laine and one of the other characters in particular were weak characters. The focus on them was mainly on them being clumsy and I would say immature. Now while this can be a part of a character, no one is perfect after all, there was no depth added to make that clumsy characteristic endearing or to show that Laine could act like more than a teenager. At least the book had more than sex and there was plot progession, but I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this story, even for the cheap price. It's short and doesn't really make the reader feel any emotion.", "label": "bad review"}

It seemed it was edited away, I don't know how to explain it. It felt too rushed, although it had the potential for something more exciting. Maybe it's because it's a short story, but I found the romance was ok, it lacked a bit of action (or angst, even if I admit I prefer the angst at a tolerable level and mine is pretty low).\n\nAll in all my rating is 3.5 stars.

Langley created a wonderful world of werewolves and mates and love and romance, and With Love is a fun tale indeed.\n\nDevlin is visiting another town, looking for a place for he and his business partner to move their construction company to. He's sizing up the local werewolf pack, introducing himself so he can scope out the feasibility of moving here. What he finds is a ruthless pack Alpha who is abusing his Omega, a werewolf named Laine, and terrorizing the rest of the pack. One thing about werewolves.... they recognize their mate instantly, that special person that Fate has chosen for him, and the omega Laine is Devlin's mate. He quickly claims Laine as his, and now must work to dispatch the Alpha and remove him from his post so the town can be in peace again and he and his Laine can live happily ever after.\n\nThe erotic nature is wonderfully sexy, it's romantic, it's funny, it's witty, and it's all-around good fun. The pace is swift, though the danger presented within the pages seems to be dispelled too easily to make for any real suspense. Still, it's a totally fun and engrossing story.\n\nI heartily recommend it, and especially recommend \"Without Reservations\" and \"With Caution\" (in that order), two more stories set in the same universe (the characters in this book have been mentioned in Without Reservations). While I enjoy the other two books more, this is still a wonderful and entertaining tale.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Devlin Johns is supposed to be meeting with Victor, the alpha of the wolf pack that resides in Asheville. However, when he arrives at the meeting site, he sees an omega being assaulted.  While omega wolves are the lowest wolves of a pack, Devlin knows that they are still invaluable to the smooth running of a pack and deserving of protection.  Getting in the middle of the ruckus, Dev stops the assault, which only re-directs the alpha's hatred toward him. Feeling a tingling along his spine, Devlin is both astonished and ecstatic that this unconscious omega might be his mate.  It isn't until the omega wakes up that Devlin will know for sure.\n\nLaine Campbell smells something wonderful as he slowly reaches consciousness.  Unsure of where he is, he opens his eyes and is instantly delighted and amazed at what he sees. He has a mate of his very own and this mate is hot! Not only is he hot, but he seems to feel the same way as Laine.  Not quite understanding how to proceed, Laine happily lets Devlin take over and enjoys every aspect of their lovemaking.\n\nLaine and Devlin set out to slowly explore their relationship.  Devlin has no plans to let Laine go, no matter that the alpha of Asheville is a jerk and a bully.  Devlin plans to show Victor how an alpha is supposed to act and he is going to enjoy every minute of it!\n\nOnce again J. L. Langley has woven a tremendous story of love and acceptance. In WITH LOVE, Laine is endearingly accident-prone and constantly making mistakes.  I found it humbling to see Devlin take him as he was, and love him in spite of his quirks.  Laine charmed me with his first smile of delight at finding Devlin by his side.

{"words": "\"I needed to put two critical ideas together: that I could both be mentally ill and lead a rich and satisfying life.\" ~ (Locations 5056-58)\n\nElyn R. Saks is a professor who has struggled with schizophrenia for most of her life. As a child she became slightly obsessive compulsive and then anorexic. As she grew older she started to have more symptoms of the disease and suffered for many years without medication.\n\nThroughout the book you will read completely honest revelations of what it is like to be on medication and to be off medication. You will be amazed at how creative a writer Elyn R. Saks is and how she remembers precises details of her life, even down to conversations she had with numerous people. Obviously she has a brilliant mind to remember with such clarity.\n\nAt times this book can be shockingly honest but it is never frightening as I thought it might be. Elyn R. Saks always seems to have protections in place so when she falls gravely ill she has a support system and friends to help her.\n\nFor some of the book you may feel frustrated that Elyn R. Saks thinks she can function without medication. Each time she is thrown back into a debilitating psychosis. The triggers are interesting and for that reason I think this book can explain a mentally ill person's basic needs for understanding and support.\n\nAs we watch Elyn R. Saks struggle with her demons we are invited into a very private world of fears most will never experience. People who are mentally ill will however really relate to the hallucinations and voices and feeling of impending doom.\n\nOverall this book is a captivating and compelling story of one woman's journey to happiness and success. As I finished this book I was so glad I had read it. The ending is profound and when Elyn R. Saks comes to terms with her illness you will feel a great sense of relief.\n\n~The Rebecca Review", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Kelly McCullough continues to rack up big points with his ongoing science/fantasy series starring Ravirn, a child of the Fates from Greek mythology.  The first book, WEBMAGE, was an excellent story, introducing a smart-mouthed, quick-thinking, magnet for trouble that reminded me a lot of Roger Zelazny's signature characters.\n\nLike Zelazny's Corwin of Amber and Jack of Shadows, Ravirn tells his own story in a first-person narrative that explodes onto the pages and keeps moving along at a brisk pace.  Since I'd read the first book, the second book, CYBERMANCY, didn't offer any challenges to lock into the world.  I felt like I was stepping back into a gathering of old friends.  That's how you know you have excellent characters - when your readers can drop back in and never wonder once who is who.\n\nI call these books science/fantasy because McCullough insists on making technology and magic both driving factors of the series.  Not only is Ravirn a child of the Fates who's gifted with awesome magical abilities, he's also a computer geek that knows his way around hacks and cracks.  As steeped as I am in computer-speak, I was sometime challenged with having to keep up with the amount of information in Ravirn's narrative, but even when I lost the thread of something (I blame my ADHD, not McCullough's writing) it didn't take me long to catch up.\n\nEven cooler than that, though, Ravirn turns out to be an emerging chaos god who's about to hang a shingle in the Greek pantheon.  That story alone is worth the price of the book.\n\nThere are lots of stories in the second book of the series, though.  Ravirn's friendship with Melchior -- the webgoblin he created, designed, programmed, and eventually gave independence to - is still at the forefront of the adventure.  Likewise, Cerice - Ravirn's lady love - returns with a host of new issues as well.  Her webgoblin's name is Shara, but she has a tendency to take a human form that looks an awful lot like Mae West, complete with ample charms and double entendre enough to make a sailor blush.\n\nAt the end of WEBMAGE, Shara inadvertently got trapped in Hell.  Hades, that is.  Cerice is as dedicated to Shara as Ravirn is to Melchior.  So you know that Ravirn has to journey to Hades, risking certain death in the Land of the Dead as he outsmarts Cerberus, the three-headed dog that guards the gates of Hades.  Thankfully, Ravirn has been playing cards with the dog/s for some time, so he knows a thing or two.\nThe story quickly takes shape as Ravirn attempts his feats of derring-do for his lady love.  Who might not even love him in the same way he loves her.  I really got into all these balls McCullough kept throwing in the air.  There's always a new reason to keep turning pages.  One of the strongest aspects about the books that I enjoy is the fact that McCullough plays fair with the whole Greek mythology.  More to the point, if not for one of the most basic myths, this story would never even have taken place.\n\nPeople who haven't tried the series really don't know what they're missing.  McCullough has true world-building skills, a great sense of Greek mythology, and the eye of a thriller writer.  The blend of technology and magic is absolutely amazing, and I'm surprised no one has thought to do it quite like this before.\n\nThe first-person narrative pulls readers in quickly and introduces them to the action and the world effortlessly.  I like the humor, the puns and the jokes, a lot.  It fits the characters perfectly.  And now, with Ravirn's mysterious future slightly more clear, I can't wait to see where the third book takes him.  I'm definitely going along for the trip when the book comes out.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Ever wondered what happened to the pantheon of Gods from Greek mythology? Well, wonder no longer because they've gone fully digital in the twenty-first century. And it puts a totally new spin on words like 'spell-checker' when magic gets mixed with computer code and hacker merges with sorcerer.\n\n\"Cybermancy\" is the sequel to \"WebMage\", in which writer Kelly McCullough first introduced us to Ravirn, descendant of the three Fates. Ravirn, or Raven as he is now often called since the events of the first book, is one hell of a hacker (pun intended!). This time he is going to need to push all his vaunted skills to the utmost because he needs to hack into Hades to retrieve his girlfriend's webgoblin Shara; in Shara's memory is locked all his girlfriend Cerice's research on her doctorate in computer science.\nThe catch? For him to bring that off, he needs to face Cerberus, the three-headed Hound of Hell which guards the River Styx and the Gate of Hell, which none may pass through save death. And Ravirn would much prefer to do that alive and in the flesh. Seems like an impossible task? Well, he does have help in the tiny shape of his trusted side-kick Melchior, his shape-changing, self-aware laptop (aka webgoblin). Having given him a subroutine designed to provide a touch of sarcasm and back talk, he long ago exceeded his specs and developed a soul. Not to mention a wicked sense of humor and a tendency to speak his mind. Can Ravirn bring it off without crashing the mweb (the magical Internet that ties all the infinite worlds of possibility into one gigantic matrix and keeps reality running)? Or without getting stuck on the wrong side of the Styx?\n\nWell, one thing for sure: if he does succeed in \"getting out alive\", all Hell will definitely break loose and he'll have made Hades, the Lord of the Dead himself, into an immortal enemy. Oh yes, and the Fates, the three crones who measure out the destiny of every living being, are just waiting for him to make a misstep since their previous confrontation so they can fall on him like the proverbial ton of bricks. Although, they'll leave the \"coming down on\" to the Furies, the three sisters Tisiphone, Alecto and Megaera, female personifications of vengeance who make harpies seem like nice, friendly Tweety-birds.\n\nKelly McCullough has created a new subgenre in science fantasy with a fascinating blend of magical, mythological and computer elements mixed into a rollicking adventure filled with wild and wicked humor and nonstop action (and a dash of romantic relief).

Interestingly, each head has it's own personality in addition to Cerberus's.  From there the action takes off with Ravirn entering Hades and attempting to leave.  Unfortunatly, while there he unleashes a virus that attacks the very essence of Necessity.\n\nMy rating is a 4 to 4.5 star book.  With Amazon I have to go with a solid number and in this case I'll round it to 4 stars.  Given the fun Mr. McCullough has with this book it might be a little hard to believe that I'd round down to 4 stars but the action was a little slower than it was last time and there was a certain predictability to the book.  I was a little disappointed with this and wish things would have flowed a little different.  A major disappointment was watching Eris whimp out.  I was also disappointed that Ravirn didn't grab toward Raven sooner than he did.  Despite these minor disappointments, the ending is very good (the action picks up and brings some interesting opening for future books ( namely Athena, I'd also like to see him work Nike in).

I completely agree with previous reviewers who have done a great job of describing the contents of the books.  I just wanted to add that both are real page turners.  Ravirn / Raven is an engaging hero and the computer / hacker stuff while probably authentic enough to satisfy the cognoscenti doesn't overwhelm the ignorant (like me) or the story line.  Other characters are perhaps not quite as well rounded - but that may be the down side of first person narrative.  I look forward to more stories!", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "The mweb (magical web) was created by Necessity. It connects all the infinite worlds of probability. Without it, the multiverse would be like a hard drive without a directory. Ravirn was designed to maintain it. He is a hacker and sorcerer. He WAS the prince of the middle house of Fate. In fact, the Fates are his great-aunts. These three are not the old hags most humans believe. They are more like Amazonian-to-the-extreme huntresses. Clothos is the spinner of life threads. Atropros wields the shears. But it was Lachesis who revoked Ravirn's name and cast him out of the family. Interestingly enough, Clotho declared him a legitimate force for chaos and gave him the new name of Raven. A name he HATES.\n\nMelchior is Raven's webgoblin. (Sort of like a familiar.) He can take the shape of a goblin or a laptop. Cerice is Raven's girlfriend. Until recently, Cerice had a webpixie named Shara. Shara could take the form of a pixie or a PDA. Shara sacrificed herself to save Raven's life. Cerice is not only hurt emotionally at Shara's death, but is also academically shattered. You see, Cerice is finishing up a doctorate in Computer Science. The little PDA has all six years of Cerice's work on it and is currently residing on the wrong side of the River Styx.\n\nSo Raven must trick Cerberus (the dread guardian of the underworld and Raven's card buddy), hack into the computer of Lucifer's, and rescue Shara. Impossible for anyone else, but not Raven. However, this is where all ... well ... Hades breaks loose. Since her rebirth, Shara has begun acting a bit strange. The mweb is fraying and will soon disappear. Persephone is dealing some sort of goddess blackmail with Raven; and this is all just the beginning.\n\nEveryone has been despairing of Raven's common sense for years. He seems to always be taking on higher entities than himself. And Raven is about to prove them all correct ... again.\n\n***** Author Kelly McCullough has the most remarkable writing talent I have ever read, in a \"myth-fanta-sci-full\" sort of way. (Yes, that is a real word. Look in the dictionary and see where I penciled it in.) Not satisfied to write a single genre or to use a sub-genre already made, he has created a new template that others will build stories upon in later years. But know this, McCullough is the original and unparalleled. An outstanding addition to this newbie genre! *****\n\nReviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "It would be rather difficult for a person who is not familiar with archeological events  to list the top ten great discoveries.  That is why this book, Ten Discoveries that Rewrote History,  by Patrick Hunt, is a great help. The author not only lists these discoveries for us but also points out their historical significance and the circumstances surrounding their discoveries.\n\nSeveral of these discoveries are generally familiar to us from newspapers, like Tutankhamen (Tut) Tomb, Machu Picchu, the Rosetta Sone, Pompeii, and Troy.  Others are vaguely familiar like Akrotiri, Nineveh, Leakys work, the tomb of 10,000.  Interestingly, several of the most famous archeological events were discovered accidentally - pure serendipity!  Others required much effort and extensive spending .  It is difficult to discuss all of them here but two stand out as very significant. Take the Rosetta Stone, which was accidentally discovered by Napoleons forces while cleaning the Nile river in 1799.  The writing on this stone enabled the deciphering of the hieroglyphic language thus opening up the ancient history of the Egyptians which was a mystery for 2000 years. But Tuts tomb was considered  the greatest discovery of the 20th Century and also the most rewarding. In a US tour in 1976 it attracted over 8 million visitors and brought over $100 million in income.\n\nThere is little doubt that archeological  exploration has been increasing steadily since archeology became an official discipline in the 18th century. Greater awareness has been one of the factors behind this. Nations have been taking pride in exploring their cultural and architectural history. But archeological projects require funds and this has been a handicap. Many believe that funds are more usefully invested elsewhere, e.g. in medical care and in fighting poverty.  As in other projects, politics are becoming instrumental in setting budgets and  priorities .\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a mystifying attachment to old archeological events and artifacts. At the state level we find Greece and Egypt in legal fights with English and other museums demanding the return of of some of their archeological objects that were captured in the old colonial days when controls were absent. Even at the family level we find people taking pride in  buying  and owning remains of old columns or artifacts even if they go back to more than 3500 years. Thankfully, this has now become illegal in most countries.\n\nFuad R Qubein\nAug. 2017", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Ten Discoveries That Rewrote History\n\nPatrick Hunt is a global archaeologist who teaches Classics and Archaeology at Stanford University. His research was featured in various history and science magazines and the History Channel. He lives in northern California with his wife, and spends several months a year abroad pursuing historical and archaeological research. The Contents of this 226 page book list the Introduction, the ten chapters, and a Selected Bibliography. This book resulted from a popular course at Stanford University. Our understanding of ancient history is influenced by a few major discoveries. Archaeology tells about the past when there are no history records. This is a very readable and interesting popular history book.\n\nChapter 1 tells about the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1797 Egypt. It allowed reading the ancient Egyptian written language. Champollion is credited for its decipherment. Chapter 2 tells about the discovery of Troy in present day Turkey in 1870 using the description in the Iliad. It was no longer a myth. The rediscovery of Troy (Ilion) helped to create modern archaeology, science not grave robbery. Chapter 3 discusses Ninevehs Assyrian Library found near Mosul in 1849. It found many works like the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Law Code of Hammurabi. The former had an account of a great flood like in Genesis. Chapter 4 tells about the discovery of King Tuts Tomb in 1922. It had never been looted and contained many treasures. Tut died young; a bad leg fracture could have caused a fatal infection.\n\nChapter 5 tells about the discovery of Machu Picchu in the Peruvian High Jungle in 1916. It is listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the World, one of the most perfect examples of Inca architecture. Chapter 6 discusses Pompeii, discovered in 1748. The eruption of Vesuvius buried Pompeii in two days. It preserved Roman architecture and artifacts. The fields around Pompeii were rich and fertile from aged lava soil. The eruption buried the town in a few hours so the remains are intact and complete. Chapter 7 tells about the Dead Sea Scrolls found in 1947. They provided information on biblical manuscripts. They were hidden during the Jewish revolt against Roman rule in 70 AD. This discovery was complicated by political conflicts.\n\nChapter 8 is about Thera, an island in the Aegean Sea. In 1969 archaeologists discovered a whole city buried by volcanic eruption around 1920 BC. Did this event result in the story of Atlantis by Plato? The uncovered buildings were sophisticated. Chapter 9 discusses the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa. Louis and Mary Leakey discovered a hominid skull from around 1.7 million years ago. They were not primates and not humans. The discovery of a complete fossil skeleton said to be over 3.2 million years old was a huge find. Chapter 10 discusses the Tomb of 10,000 Warriors found in central China when farmers were digging a well during a drought. These terra-cotta warriors are detailed with individual features that represented ten different Chinese ethnic groups. This is the largest mausoleum in the world. It records the advanced metallurgy of China from 22 centuries ago.\n\nThis is worth reading for general information.

Rosalind has no memory of her life before the Sherbrookes found her and after six months of not saying a word, the first time she speaks is to sing a song.\n\nNow Rosalind is all grown up and is having her first season in London when she meets Nicholas Vail, a mysterious man who seems completely taken with her. When Rosalind's best friend, Ryder's son Grayson, finds a magical book written in code, no one but Rosalind can make sense of it. Now the trio is about to uncover some very surprising secrets, and Rosalind finds herself falling madly in love with Nicholas, who has his own reasons for wanting to stay close to Rosalind. But her past is about to find her...\n\nI may have read some of Coulter's works in the past but if I did it's been so long I can't remember anything about them. I was intrigued by the concept of The Wizard's Daughter and had to give it a try. Unfortunately I was disappointed and even worse, the title of the book gives away a key element that isn't revealed until almost the end of the book. The story would have had a much more powerful impact if we didn't already know who Rosalind was from the title.\n\nThe story takes quite a while to really get going. Partially this is due to character history, but a big part is all the time spent where all they are doing is reading the magical book. I loved the idea of having a mystery that is only uncovered by translating the secret encoded message. I just didn't feel it was necessary to spend so much time where that's all they are doing. Maybe that was the only way to get the mystery across, but it seems to me there could've been a way to do it that was a little more interesting.\n\nHowever, once the bulk of the book translation is done, events start unfolding at quite a rapid pace as we find out who Rosalind is and why she has forgotten all these years. I never really bought entirely into the romance of Nicholas and Rosalind however. I can't even explain why, I just didn't feel the chemistry that should be present between two people who fall madly in love overnight, even if Nicholas did have ulterior motives in the beginning. I was more interested in Grayson and wish we could have spent a little more time with him. I can only hope he has his own story coming before too long as I'd love to spend more time with him.\n\nWhile The Wizard's Daughter felt rather uneven to me and I thought more could have been done with the story, I did enjoy it enough to finish the book. I also enjoyed getting to know the Sherbrooke clan and look forward to reading more about them.

{"words": "I can see I am siding with the minority opinion again, but I really liked this book. Yes, there were some unanswered questions, and a few parts were confusing, but I think a book about magic is supposed to be that way. It is the realm of the unexplained, after all, so there is no clear need to explain everything.\n\nI enjoyed Rosalind's personality. She is very sensible and good-humored, even when dealing with trying circumstances. I loved the way she stood up to her step-mother-in-law, who was dreadful in a very satisfying way. You could tell she grew up among Sherbrookes. She had the Sherbrooke \"voice\".\n\nI'm not sure I understood if Rosalind was a debt, or if she was owed a debt, and it is not clear how Nicholas paid the debt to Rosalind, or if he paid it to someone else, or himself. It is very mysterious. I'm willing to accept that magic is mysterious, and if the book was written in a more straight-forward way, it would possibly be boring. Really, I had no complaint with any of that.\n\nI thought it was a real page turner, and I am looking forward to the sequel. (There will be a sequel, won't there? And all those questions we have will be answered later?)", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I picked this book up as I've always had a fondness for Ms Coulter's Sherbrook family. Even though the family is only tangently attached, I was hoping for a good read. It starts out well, but then the romance moves a little too quickly; I prefer a little more sexual tension & conflict before the romantic heroes decide they're right for each other. But then the novel turns into a weak attempt at a Patricia McKillip-like fantasy and loses the relationship development. The fantasy world nags at me like a sore tooth. The fantasy is random, meanders, makes no real sense, and simply falls flat. It's a rather simplistic yet nonsensical alternate world without real weight to it. I'm left feeling like I thought I picked up that wonderfully, rich Ghirardelli dark chocolate and ended up with the cheap, awful milk chocolate accidentally purchased at the dollar store...", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "I have to agree with several of the reviewers.  I have read most if not all of Ms. Coulter's works, and this one just doesn't do it for me.  She did describe her own writing(to quote another reviewer), \"for a child--simple, basic, crude, if you will.\" [page 63].  I felt like this was a strain for Ms Coulter.  All the dialogue was so different from previous Sherbrooke books.  I found myself asking, why are Ryder, Douglas and their brides speaking and acting this way?  I realize they're older, but doddering idiots?  It was shocking.  I hate not finishing a book (although I thought about here), but I did finish the book, and thought it was a waste.  I will continue to buy her products as I'm hoping this is a fluke and do so enjoy her stories, normally.  I hope you didn't do this to the next FBI series book! Oh, my.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "The best thing I can say about this book was that they were a cute couple!  (I liked her sassy personality even though she was too modern to be a regency heroine.)\nOther than that this book is poorly plotted and does not succeed as a fantasy novel.  The fantasy world is boring, poorly thought out, and described - very unconvincing.  This book had quite a few potentially interesting characters and all the plot elements so that it could have been quite good.  Unfortunately, it never happened.  Except in her most recent book, Mary Jo Putney does Regency Romances with fantasy MUCH better.  My recommendation is to get this one from the Library.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "I have enjoyed many of Ms. Coulter's books. I also enjoy Paranormal romances (e.g. M.J.Putney and Jayne Ann Krentz).  The premise of this book is quite interesting (and is shown above so I will not repeat it). The book started off strong, with Ms. Coulter's standard rapid-fire dialogue.  One minor weak spot was that the characters seem to fall in love without any real interaction. However, the ending was quite rushed. The author spent hundreds of pages developing the story and mystery just to have everything wrapped up in \"the pale\" crammed into less than 50 pages. Also, the ending was confusing and I had to re-read it a few times to make sure I really understood it.\n\nFinally, there were A LOT of loose ends such as ***SPOILER*** who shot at Nicholas, how did her \"foster\" brother's desire to solve the myster play into things, what was up with the scepter with the \"feeling of magic\" that Nicholas and Grayson saw - but nothing happened with, how could Nicholas be both himself and Egan...and many more loose ends ***END OF SPOILERS*** I am not sure if all of these loose ends and characters that went nowhere were to setup future books or what.\n\nTo sum, I would recommend checking this out of the library to read and save your money for a better book.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "A very long time ago Captain Jared Vail was the only survivor when his ship and crew were lost at sea in a terrible storm.  He awakes to find a bright light and someone telling him he is fine and that this person saved him so now Jared owes him a debt.  The person on the other side of the light asks if Captain Vail will promise to pay this debt and he finally does.  He is shown a young girl with red hair, blue eyes and freckles who sings a song and says \"I am your debt.\"\n\nNow we come to the \"present\" of London, April 22, 1835 and Nicholas Vail is at a ball looking/hunting for a young woman he knows is there. He spots her with her beautiful dark red hair, pale skin.  She is happy and laughing and he knows she is the one.  She is a ward of Ryder Sherbrooke and is having her first season in London.  She meets Nicholas Vail, Earl of Mountjoy, and they are both comfortable with and attracted to each other albeit for different reasons.  Nicholas has been gone from England and made his way in Macau.  She had named herself as her memory was gone when Ryder Sherbrooke found her beaten in an alley so her name is Rosalind de La Fontaine.  Nicholas comes to call the next day and Rosalind, her \"adopted\" brother Grayson Sherbrooke and Nicholas visit an art and book fair in the park where Grayson purchases a very ancient book purported to have been written by a wizard.  Neither Grayson nor Nicholas can translate and read the code in the book but Rosalind can.\n\nThis story is very different from Ms. Coulter's FBI series and even the normal Sherbrooke historical romances but it is very well done.  The story has several plot lines plus some \"evil\" stepbrothers and stepmother who also cause trouble.  I found it a tad rushed at the end but still a wonderful setup and conclusion.\n\nHighly recommended.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I almost didn't buy this book because of the author's flaky-sounding name, which made the book sound like it would offer a bunch of new-age pseudo-wisdom crap.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it originally started out as a poem --and a beautiful one at that-- about love: the ache for profound, delicious love all of us have and seldom find, be it towards a lover, a friend, or even towards our own selves. It speaks candidly and courageously about stumbling through life, mistake after mistake, while all the time growing and learning and reaching (hopefully) for a wiser, happier, more intimate and more fulfilling life.\n\nI loved the question she posed to herself, hopefully to be answered positively at the end of one's life: Did I love well?\n\nAfter each stanza (or passage, since this poem is written in prose), Oriah explains what she means with stories from her own life. Then, at the end of each chapter, she offers a meditation to open our hearts to that particular blessing within ourselves.\n\nI enjoyed this book.

{"words": "This is a nice group of Harlequin books with some YA/mature sexual content.  Several of the characters appear in most of the books, making them seem like old friends as you read.\n\nThe first book started slow and was just a little disappointing.  The main characters were rather wimpy, and the Vampires (in all of the books) are quite weak and susceptible to injury compared to what most of us are used to reading.  I was wondering at that point whether I was going to have to struggle through the rest of the books.  Dialogue sometimes seemed a little stilted and awkward.\n\nThe next 4 books kept getting better and better.  Part of that might have been because the repeating characters were getting more interesting as their personalities were developing.  The final book seemed too short, and because it had none of the familiar characters, was not as interesting for me.\n\nOverall, a good read.

The first book I ever read to make a vampire the romantic lead, you kicked off a genre that has exploded and will not be stopped.  Truly groundbreaking, I thank you so much for leading the way and clearing a path for more.\n\nIf you haven't read these books, DO SO NOW!\n\nA human can only become a vampire if they contain a rare blood antigen, and each vampire has one human with the antigen (a chosen) whom they feel drawn to protect.  A government agency, DPI (department of paranormal investigations), is out to capture and make lab rats out of every vampire possible and they're not above using The Chosen to do it.  And if they can't capture, they don't hesitate to kill.\n\nWith this series, you get a complete story of two characters in each book, but we still get to reacquaint ourselves with some of our favorites along the way.\n\nHaving read these books as a teenager, I was hesitant to reread them as an adult.  So many books that I loved back then fail to resonate with me now.  Wings in the night did not disappoint and I was enthralled once again.\n\nI truly believe that without this series, we would have no Twilight, no Midnight Breed, and no Blackdagger Brotherhood.

I didn't like that. It's either that they're good people just different or they are dark monsters. You can't be both. The other thing, I'm not sure how to put into words, but the author kept going on and on about the characters thoughts. For example, Jamison thought he disgusted Angelica. He kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on (it's getting annoying isn't it?). Yeah! I ended up skipping sections when the characters did this.

This is not to say the others are not based on a foundation of fact, rather the draw more heavily from works the posit a certain version of the future. THis one, however, draws heavily upon Constitutional history to make points. I found this refreshing because it showed me that the conservative commentator can be informed, not simply opinionated. This just made the book a really impressive work. The main point of the book is that the unchecked power of the judiciary has gone too far, and is threatening the individual freedom that American citizens enjoy.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Mark Levin's premise of the power grab and over-importance of the Supreme Court is a fantastic summary of a stealth time bomb. Although Levin leans far right, the problem with the Court is that if you lucky enough to live long in the US, eventually the power will hurt both the right and left. Some of his examples are absolutely amazing in regards to the power these judges have in using their opinions on right and wrong. The job of the court is to interpret law, not make it up and not to shape society. I was taken back a bit from Levine's defense of the lack of power in both the president and congress but it makes sense in the big picture... those two bodies of government are elected by the people.. not the supreme court justices. In order to really be objective in analyzing the power of the court, don't judge short term and realize that eventually both conservatives and liberals will rue the day that 9 people decide our fate.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "What's the most pressing problem facing our nation? Well, there are a ton to choose from. You could say external forces looking to exterminate us. That would certainly be valid, but I'm always been more of an implosion versus explosion guy in terms threats. Frankly, I think our own seditionists are the biggest threat to our liberty. They'll bring down this country far earlier than any terrorists ever will. Over the last forty years the radicals have marched through our organizations, universities, and government and allowed what was once the counter-culture to become the culture. Nowhere is this more true than in our judiciary wherein the laws crafted by our representatives in the legislature have been struck down by judges who think it is their role to teach us what we should really want.\n\nIn the words of former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall: You do what you think is right and let the law catch up. Only, it's not the judiciary's role to make laws and that's why Mark Levin penned his masterpiece Men in Black: How the Supreme Court is Destroying America. The book came out in 2005 so, as always, I got to its pages a little late. Unfortunately, nothing is going to change in the immediate future so it remains pertinent. Some of you may know Mark Levin's name, but, honestly, before this year I never listened to his talk radio show. After a month I discovered he's the best host out of them all. He also excels at writing. Essentially, Men in Black mirrors his approach to verbal conservatism: it's insightful, concise, and ruthlessly on topic. There's not a wasted word here. What I found most attractive about its narrative is that he makes extensive use of primary source documents. He lets the justices, in their opinions, tell their own tale. The book is a compilation of history and cogent analysis. He discusses specifically several of the 100 justices who have been members of the Supreme Court, and their flaws were readily apparent. They were men, not gods.\n\nLevin offers readers an outstanding discussion of the most important court cases in our nation's history. Many of them I had read about before but have long since forgotten. His discussion of religion in Chapter 3 and the establishment clause was thoroughly enlightening. Specifically, we see how cases like Everson v. Board of Education created the fallacious doctrine of there being a \"wall of separation\" between church and state. Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Wallace v. Jeffree illustrates the method by which this notion was created. \"Justices in the Bedroom\" in Chapter Five was a standout as well, but most topical was Chapter Ten, \"Silencing Political Debate.\" To what extent does McCain-Feingold erode our liberties? Right now it's hard to say. I agree with the author that advertising is speech, and the recent letter Obama sent to the Justice Department concerning the William Ayers ad put out by a 527 organization is an example of how the left will take advantage of any loophole as a means to silence their critics. Overall, we are not as free as we used to be and Mark Levin's Men in Black illustrates why this is the case.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Men in Black is a book about excessive government power. It isn't concerned so much with legislative or executive power. Rather, this is a book about the growing power and influence of the Supreme Court; a court that author Mark Levin feels has overstepped its boundaries and taken upon itself to write the law in its own terms, often against the will of the people.\n\nLevin speaks with authority on the issue of Supreme Court responsibility and the division of power among the three branches of the U.S. government. He is a Constitutional lawyer so he is certainly qualified to write a book such as this. However, this book doesn't necessarily present the strongest case against Supreme Court authority and abuse of power and many of its arguments are weak and sometimes contradictory. One of the arguments the author makes throughout the book, for example, is that a law that has been voted into place by the people should almost always stand; without interference from the Supreme Court or any other court trying to overturn it. But what this type of argument fails to point out is that, since the United States was founded as a Republic form of government, the rights of all people- majority, minority, and otherwise- must be respected and upheld. Rights are not up for a vote, but based on Levin's reasoning, he seems to think it's okay to take away certain rights if the ballot results say so.\n\nLevin also argues against other things that many American's cherish, like the right to privacy. True, there is no explicit right to privacy granted in the Constitution, but that doesn't mean it isn't an implied right, intended by the nation's founders. Surveys show that the majority of Americans feel that privacy is a right and should be Constitutionally protected. Levin feels it is not a right and that the Supreme Court should not treat it as such. It's interesting how the book so Levin so quickly changes his position on democracy and the importance of upholding the will of the people when they vote something into law. If a vote of the people confirms the right to privacy, one would think that someone like Levin would agree that it should be made into law. But based on his other convictions in this book, he would likely be against it, in direct contradiction of some of his other stands on the issues and the Supreme Court's authority to decide them.\n\nIn spite of Men In Black's faulty reasoning, there are some parts worth reading. The best chapter (by far) is chapter 10, \"Silencing Political Debate\". Here, the book accurately points out the very unconstitutional and un- American McCain- Feingold act of 2002 and how it silences free speech by making it a crime to talk about politicians in the days leading up to an election. How this ever became law and survived a review by the Supreme Court, I will never know. Levin is one- hundred percent correct in his criticism of this act and I share his disgust. Besides this chapter, there are some other good points made regarding certain individual laws (many are mentioned in the book) from over the years and how their fate was decided by the Supreme Court and they also make for good reading.\n\nOverall, however, Men in Black isn't quite the incredible work of constitutional writing that some of its endorsers claim. Mark Levin seems upset at the Supreme Court more for the trend toward more liberal thinking than for its supposed violations of the U.S. Constitution. If the Supreme Court was violating the Constitution in favor of a position that he and his fellow conservatives approve, then I doubt he would say anything about it. He also seems to believe that the will of the people is sufficient to trample on rights. It all adds up to a less than average book that fails to convince me of its initial premise: That the U.S. Supreme Court has excessive power and wields too much influence. It's a nice effort, but it doesn't quite convince.", "label": "bad review"}

In this book he has gather a tremendous amount of legalese and historical cases and has brought it all together sucessfully in a treatise that goes a long way to proving the points he wants to make.  That is the the Supreme Court has overstepped its boundaries of interpreting the law of the law to making decisions that in effect create the law of the land.  For the purposes of this review, I will not add any personal feelings on the matter but let Levin's book make its own points.\n\nLaw is usually a boring subject for most of us and this book is written in a way that is never boring.  You'll have yourself Googling a lot of what is presented here to validate the facts and you will be hard pressed to come up with any dispute.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Mark Levin's book falls into some of the usual pitfalls that almost all biased political argumentation today falls into--evidence is often stretched and recontextualized to fit certain predisposed conclusions.  The book is clearly well researched, and Levin is no doubt quite knowledgeable about legal process and the language of the US Constitution, but his conclusions are often stretched to a degree that no longer fits the evidence.  I would hesitate comparing his method to a smokescreen, for I am not entirely sure if Levin is purposefully making exaggerated claims that he doesn't support but artfully disguises in the ethos of research, but at the core of many of his ideas are assumptions or basic contradictions that he just can't back up.\n\nFor example, Levin is trying to show with this book that there is a long-term conspiracy of liberalism that has been slowly forging opportunities for itself in the process of applying the Constitution to the cases before it so that there would be precedent to back what Levin calls unConstitutional decisions like in Roe vs. Wade.  Levin pushes a good case to look further (personally) into the basis of that and other decisions and if they do have Constitutional basis, but Levin instead goes into a history lesson of the decisions that predicated decisions like Roe vs. Wade with the assumption that every opportunity opened in previous decisions regarding things like the right to privacy was in fact the doing of a long-term liberal plan to open the doors of power for an activist court.  Certainly, legal cases are often made on the grounds of precedent, but instead of revealing the focus on precedent rather than the Constitution as a problem in the deliberations of the Supreme Court, Levin tries to turn the problem into an unsupportable conspiracy that comes across on the edge of paranoia rather than sound, unbiased reason.  And when Levin starts out the book stating that the justices should be treated as humans rather than gods, he wants to convey the idea that their actions may be questioned, but will not acknowledge himself that the history of precedents may also be the mistakes of the same human beings whom he does not want us to deify.\n\nLevin also breaks his guise of the the reasonable viewer of history when he tries to establish the intents of the founding fathers, equating Jefferson's participation in prayer services at Congress as a direct negation of his over-used mention of the wall of separation.  Clearly, Levin cannot see no possible correlation between the two, and thus the questioning of the validity of prayer in schools must be a moot argument.  Just to make sure that his bias is clear, he throws in a little slippery scare tactic of suggesting a future where religious observance is also banned in the home.\n\nLevin makes the same kind of rhetorical blunders when he suggests that Blackmun may have turned 'left' under the influence of his wife (while giving a little shot in the arm to Richard Nixon for having the foresight of wanting to base a Supreme Court nomination partly on the quality of a man's wife).  When discussing the famous argument over the inclusion of \"under God\" in the pledge of allegiance, Levin focuses more on how much the plaintiff's daughter actually wanted to say the phrase, which is of course moot when considering the actual legitimacy of requiring the phrase in a patriotic statement.\n\nIn the end, this book comes across as yet another argument of bias in what has clearly become a divisive popular culture--evidently, a book isn't commercially viable unless it has a line to hold, no matter which side.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "Time and again complaints rage against the \"activist\" judges on the US Supreme Court.  Mark Levin, an excellent example of zealous advocate for his particular view serves as a fine case in point.  For most people it seems that the epithet activist merely means the court does something that the particular person does not like.  Thus Levin defines the court as activist when it strikes down flag burning laws based on the first amendment and just as quickly brands the court with the same term when it fails to over turn the McCain-Feingold campaign finance system on the same basis.\n\nProfessor Levin, like ideological advocates on both sides, shed great heat but little light on the issue of the court.  Citizens as a whole would be better served by arguments that laid out a philosophical basis under which they believed the court should strike down laws, rather than simply presenting case by case arguments which rest mostly on how one feels about the particular case.  Generally, one would expect conservatives to be extremely circumspect when it comes to overturning the \"popular will\" (a legislative action) and narrowly construe their own authority.  Yet interestingly, those considered conservative on the current court in the tally at the end of every session prove themselves more inclined to strike down laws put in place by the people's representatives than do their \"liberal\" colleagues.  Does this make them activists? Levin does not think so, primarily because he agrees with their decisions.\n\nGiven the many attacks against originalists like the author, one would have expected a better refutation of his opponent's arguments.  Professor Levin ascribes to a theory that judges must interpret laws based on the understanding of the drafters who framed them, thus the \"original\" intent.  Yet here we find fine fodder for those who argue that originalists only look to such history when it suits their particular current position.  Thus, conservatives like Levin claim the 14th Amendment voids affirmative action schemes, yet fail to consider that the same post Civil War congress that passed the 14th also passed legislation creating various affirmative action programs to assist African American citizens.  Since one can hardly imagine a congress passing an Amendment and then passing legislation that directly violates their intent, one must believe that they saw the 14th Amendment as consistent with such programs.\n\nSuch zealous advocacy no doubt serves professor Levin well as a lawyer, but it does little to aid the understanding of his readers.  The Supreme Court remains a powerful and complex organization and perhaps the least well understood by the citizenry.  This problem will only be remedied by education, not ideological advocacy.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "In MEN IN BLACK, Mark Levin, the conservative radio talk host, turns his attention to an area of Americana that has suddenly shifted gears from dry and dusty to hot and relevant.  He notes that the Supreme Court forms one angle of the triangle that in effect governs America.  The Presidency and the Senate over the years have struggled with the Supreme Court and each other in a bear hug that historically was more or less even.  However, Levin notes that the Court has grown powerful beyond the scope envisioned for it by the Founding Fathers, who set it up as a check on the other two.  The Court, they held, was to interpret the law, a formidably strong enough concept indeed.  Yet, Levin accuses the Court of overstepping its bounds in a manner that places it squarely in the camp of a leftist ideology that he fears has turned the United States into a bizarre nation that opposes nearly every precept once held dearly by Washington, Jefferson, and Madison.  No longer is the America of 2005 a nation that opposes racism (affirmative action is the \"settled law\" of a racist ideology that the Founding Fathers would have found abhorrent) nor is it one that will protect its citizens from foreign incursions (the Court now insists that captured Islamofascist terrorists must be accorded the constitutional right to face their accusers in a court of law).  Levin argues that the Court has proven over the last fifty years that the fate of the Democratic party and the fate of the Court itself are inextricably intertwined.  MEN IN BLACK was written before the recent arrival of John Roberts as Chief Justice.  With the looming confirmation hearings of Samuel Alitto as the newest conservative justice, Levin must be heartened by the likely prospect of a reversal of a court that has looked over its left shoulder for so long that it forgot that it even had a right one.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Lawyer and conservative talk show host Mark Levin has written an admirable and long overdue book with \"Men In Black: How the Supreme Court Is Destroying America.\" We've had books about overreaching presidents and an out of control Congress, so why not level our sights at the Supreme Court of the United States? Anyone with half a brain knows a number of justices sitting on that body possess a most unusual view on how the Constitution ought to work. And increasingly, ideology seems to have little to do with the madness that passes for legal reasoning in those hallowed chambers. We need to look no further than the recent Kelo decision, in which the high court declared constitutional the right of government to seize private property in order to pass it on to non-public developers. Both liberals and conservatives exploded with real anger over this ruling. Eminent domain always allowed the government to take property, with just compensation of course, for important public uses. But now we've got a court that says if a company or other economic concern can pay more taxes on a piece of land, thus providing more income for the government, then poorer citizens need to clear off. Another nail in America's coffin!\n\nLevin's book goes far beyond Kelo--which wasn't decided by the time the book went to press, sadly--to expose a pattern of extraconstitutional shenanigans that's been going on for years. Right from the start, the author gives us an example of what he sees as a central problem in the court's functioning. We all know that justices, when confirmed by the Senate, serve for as long as they wish. What happens when a member stays on the court for so long that health issues cripple their ability to adjudicate cases? Nothing, really. Levin gives us a list of justices who went insane, fell ill with dementia, or otherwise suffered an affliction that hampered their intellectual faculties. They remained on the bench. Moreover, what should we do about justices who no longer express much of an interest in doing their jobs? According to \"Men in Black,\" this has actually happened. Thurgood Marshall spent most of his last years on the court ignoring briefings in favor of a heavy diet of soap operas in his private chambers. Congress may impeach justices at all levels of the federal judiciary for various criminal offenses, a power they haven't invoked in ages, but incapacitation due to illness or boredom seems beyond their purview.\n\nThe bulk of Levin's book outlines specific topics and the cases associated with them. In nearly every instance, the doctrine (it's now been around for so long that it's essentially a doctrine) of judicial activism rears its ugly head again and again. Levin calls the Dred Scott case, in which the high court denied citizenship to blacks, an egregious example of activist law. The Korematsu decision, in which the justices upheld the government's right to intern Japanese-Americans during the war, is another case mentioned here. Separation of Church and State? A bedrock principle laid out in the Bill of Rights, and one the founders intended to keep government out of the business of sanctioning state religions, has now been used by activist courts to drive religion out of the public sphere entirely. In issues as important and diverse as immigration, freedom of speech, race relations, elections, and citizenship rights the Supreme Court has either invented rights out of thin air or stretched pre-existing language in the Constitution to impose their own views on American Society. The most contentious social issue of modern times, abortion and Roe v. Wade, eventually came about because the high court created a right to privacy back in the 1960s.\n\nI liked the book, but I would because I'm a conservative. Most judicial activists seem to subscribe to liberalism. Levin takes this view as well, and it's tough to argue with him. Conservatives wouldn't support affirmative action, which is essentially state sanctioned discrimination, nor would they condone expanding rights enjoyed by citizens to non-citizens. Yet we have laws upheld by the Supreme Court that do these very things. We've got laws that have turned the Commerce Clause into a means of allowing the federal government to regulate intrastate activities. I won't go as far as Levin does and blame the court entirely for these problems, since institutions and lobbying groups leave their fingerprints all over some of these laws long before they find their way to the Supreme Court, but no where is it written that the justices have to uphold this nonsense or take advantage of the situation to create entirely new laws and rights. I wish the author underscored this point better. I also wish he would have talked about precedent, a big topic today. Liberals scream about precedent because they want to protect Roe v. Wade, arguing that it can't be overturned because it's \"settled law.\" By that reasoning we shouldn't have overturned Plessy v. Ferguson or Korematsu, right?\n\n\"Men In Black\" couldn't be a timelier read. With President Bush gaining the opportunity to appoint two new justices to the Supreme Court, and the possibility of another appointment if Justice Stevens retires in the next couple of years (he's 85 now), the high court could go through a radical re-alignment that may last for decades. Millions of us hope and pray this happens. It's long past time to roll back the radicalism that marks the Supreme Court's jurisprudence of the last three decades in favor of more originalist readings that will return stability to the nation's legal system. If you're planning on watching the upcoming Senate hearings on Bush's latest appointment (Notice I'm not saying it will be Harriet Miers; she looks like she's in big trouble), reading this book will give you a good background on many of the questions and topics that will likely arise.", "label": "good review"}

Remember his appeal to common sense and the power of his oratory?  Then recall the analysis of his speech afterward by respected voices from all frequencies on the political spectrum?  The conclusion: his speech didn't change a single mind, didn't capture a single vote for the President.  The problem was that his appeal was not to the middle, where the difference is made, but to the already committed.  Men in Black follows suit.  It is designed to make Conservatives more comfortable with their conservatism.  It is an articulate  presentation of the argument for \"originalism,\" or as it used to be called, \"strict constructionism.\"  If the Constitution doesn't say anything about abortion, then issues related to abortion cannot be adjudicated by the Supreme Court.  A perusal of the chapter headings reveals its themes: Radicals in Robes...Justices in the Bedroom...Endorsing Racism...Al Qaeda Gets a Lawyer...and my personal favorite, Socialism from the Bench.  Mark Levin is absolutely right; his arguments are sound, and the logic is well-developed.

{"words": "It disappoints me that I can not be more enthusiastic about \"Men In Black.\" Though I consider myself a conservative, I find that Mark Levin goes beyond conservativism into partisanship.\n\n  This is regrettable because Levin does succeed in explaining, particularly to lay audience, the history of the Supreme Court and its rightful place in American government, which are subjects that most people don't understand. The mechanics of the court system are not, for most people, comprehensible, much less exciting. Here, Levin provides solid scholarship accessible to the average person.\n\n  Levin does well in explaining and demonstrating how the Supreme Court - and all levels of our courts - have strayed from the intent of the Founders and established themselves as an unelected government superior in their own minds to the legislative and executive branches of government.\n\n  There can be no doubt of the accuracy of Levin's argument. The problem of \"Men In Blsck\" lies in Levin's adoption of certain cases and movements as evidence. For example, Levin chastises the  Court for holding that burning the American flag is protected under the First Amendment. Well, I consider myself a conservative - and I agree with the Court. There are simply some issues that resonable people can disagree on, but Levin doesn't seem to allow that latitude. This is regrettable, because generally Levin's arguments are strong. Likewise, Levin allows himself to get wrapped up in Roe v. Wade and the entire abortion issue. There are many people, like myself, who believe that the legal reasoning in Row v. Wade is lacking, if not entirely non-existent. Yet it is possible at the same time for even conservatives to believe the ultimate holding is correct. In fact, I know that I am not alone in believing that abortion does constitute the taking of a human life, but that government has absolutely no right to dictate what a woman may do with regard to her own body. In other words, Roe v. Wade is simply not a good way to illustrate the truth of Levin's theme that \"the Supreme Court is destroying America.\" It is: but Roe v. Wade is not likely to get the majority of people to agree with that premise.\n\n  As I said, I wish I could offer \"Men In Black\" higher praise, but I think Levin picked the wrong way to illustrate by choosing polarizing examples. There are numerous other Supreme Court decisions he could have used that would have brought home the point that courts in general need to be reined in and brought under the control of the people, as the Founders intended.\n\nJerry", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I just finished reading Men in Black and there are several positive and negative things about this book.\n\nThe positives:  The book really makes you think about where you stand on issues.  I consider myself a conservative but as I read the book (knowing that the book would most likely take a conservative slant) I found myself wondering whether I really agreed with what the author was trying to say.  The book is sectioned off well and the author includes several interesting quotes not only from the founding fathers but also from Supreme Court justices throughout the history of the country.  Mr. Levin also does a fairly good job of presenting his argument and convincing you that his point of view is the correct one in most cases.\n\nThe negative:  I enjoy listening to Rush Limbaugh (though I don't on a regular basis).  However, if I were trying to convince the very divided population of this nation that I was correct on something I would not include a foreward by Mr. Limbaugh.  That automatically convinces some people that the book is without fault but it also automatically convinces some that the book has no truth in it.  I also feel like the book didn't have very strong standings in some of it's chapters.  It seemed that sometimes the author was picking \"hot button\" topics and was trying to wrap his argument around that topic in order to create discussion instead of because he really believed in it.\n\nBottom Line:  This is a very interesting book and I would recommend reading it whether you consider yourself conservative, liberal or somewhere in between.

{"words": "Mark Levin does a very good job at outlining the huge problem of judicial tyranny, citing evidence for it, and providing sensible (albeit very difficult to implement) solutions.\n\nAnyone who has been an observer of the courts over the years has seen numerous examples of arrogant judges who have imposed their political prejudices on the nation.  Many judges at all levels operate with no regard for the Constitution or the limits on their power.  A very recent example is the district court judge in the Schiavo case who ignored Congress and the president when they asked for a review of the case.\n\nAlthough the framers of our Constitution did a great job at putting checks on Congress and the president, they didn't do as well in restraints on the courts.  This Constitutional `Achilles heel' has allowed the judiciary in general, and the Supreme Court in particular, to function as an oligarchy.  Five unelected, unaccountable justices on the Supreme Court have usurped power to the point that they can essentially dictate policy to the nation.\n\nLevin does a very good job of showing many areas where this has occurred including citing specific cases and providing hundreds of footnotes.  Some areas where the Court has acted outside the scope of its authority that Levin lists include the following:  Forcing tax money to be spent on services for illegal aliens, allowing political speech to be limited, interfering with local school operations, farm quotas, prison policies, partial birth abortion, etc.  He demonstrates how the Court has usurped authority rightly belonging to the states, Congress, and the Executive.\n\nI don't think that he puts enough blame on the Congress and President for allowing this to happen.  They certainly have had remedies available, but have failed to exercise them effectively.\n\nAnother thing that Mr. Levin does very well is making it clear that these judges who usurp power have no more wisdom than anyone else and sadly, in many cases, far less.  He goes through some of the horrendous decisions of the Court such as Dred Scott, Plessy v. Ferguson, and the the McCain-Feingold Act.\n\nHe also provides several examples of justices who stayed in power after they seemingly had dementia issues or otherwise didn't fulfill their duties appropriately.  In addition, he reviews the likes of former justices like Hugo (KKK) Black and Felix Frankfurter (who aided the career of notorious spy Alger Hiss).\n\nThere are issues in the book with which I disagree with Mr. Levin.  For example, he seemed to be contradictory in his commentary on Korematsu v. U.S.  A main contention of the book is the problems with judicial activism and the Court not deferring to the Executive in areas in which it should.  Then he cited Korematsu, which was essentially a case where the Court did defer to FDR regarding the internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry during WWII.  I think that internment was terrible, but I do not think that this decision was judicial activism.  It certainly seemed to be a case of deferring to the Executive.\n\nAlthough Levin does a very good job of outlining the problems with the courts (or as the book's subtitle is `How the Supreme Court is Destroying America'), the best part of the book is the section that contains his proposed solutions.  He has cited some that are already available to Congress and the president such as limiting the jurisdiction of the courts in certain areas, impeachment, and recess appointments.  Additionally, he has suggested Constitutional amendments allowing a Congressional override of Supreme Court decisions with a 2/3 vote of Congress and limiting the terms of federal judges to twelve years.  For those who want to be able to keep a particularly outstanding judge, he suggests making them eligible to be reappointed after the twelve year period if they can again win Senate confirmation.\n\nThis is a very important and much needed book.  I would encourage everyone to read it and encourage their members of Congress to read it and adopt the solutions provided.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Until I saw Levin on C-Span, I did not plan to buy this volume--I assumed it was just another in the long string of whacky \"the Supreme Court is destroying our nation\" genre of diatribes.  Well, while I disagree with much of Levin's analysis, this is certainly a substantial volume deriving of serious attention.  That being said, Levin's methodology is flawed in several respects.  First, he equates judicial activism with non-originalist interpretation--yet many of the Court's supposed judicial \"originalists\" [Scalia, Rehnquist, Thomas] have been extremely activist in utilizing Court power as witness the 2000 election decisions. Second, much of the initial chapters is devoted to Levin simply ticking off various Supreme Court decisions which he considers to be subversive, crazy or both. Some of these decisions do certainly qualify as \"self-inflected wounds\" to be sure, but this approach becomes a bit tiresome. Things pick up, however, later with very strong chapters on immigration, the commerce clause, state power and other topics. It is clear that, to the extent Levin represents the \"Federalist Society\" point of view, Justice Kennedy has become a prime target of criticism, as to a lesser extent has Sanda Day O'Conner due to their \"lapses\" in upholding conservative interpretations of the Constitution in key cases. To his credit, Levin criticizes both the Florida Supreme Court (extensively) and the U.S. Supreme Court (a bit) relative to the 2000 election decisions. One of the most interesting and valuable sections of the book is Levin's focus on \"liberal\" interest groups hooking up with supporters on the Hill to try and frustrate conservative judicial nominations.  He includes as an appendix various memos exchanged between interest groups and Senate staffers which are quite interesting to read.  While they are, hardly, as shocking as Levin suggests, nonetheless they are quite fascinating--especially given the upcoming warfare that will ensue when President Bush nominates a Justice or Chief Justice.  All told, a good solid read that stimulates the adrenalin.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "To those who seem to have only now discovered this book is \"conservative,\" congratulations! The definition of conserve is \"to protect from loss or harm,\" and the author is trying his best to argue that the Supreme Court today is causing loss and harm to a quaint old document we call the Constitution of the United States.\n\nIn fact, Dr. Levin makes no bones about rolling back the clock and taking government back from these appointed dictators who have given themselves the power to change the Constitution by a simple majority vote. But even liberals can be conservative about some things, and vice versa, and Levin makes the stark point that if we ignore this problem and wait for someone else to do something about it, we'll one day wake up in a country the founders would have taken up arms to overthrow!\n\nTo those who read this book and think the balance of powers between the three branches of government is how it should be, congratulate yourselves for helping to pave the road ahead to fascism. In fact, this book is so conservative in wanting to preserve the original intent of the founders, that were they here today, all of them -- even Hamilton -- would strongly endorse what Levin has written. It's the clarion call to resistance, and Democrats and Rempublicans would do well to heed this warning, because if it's not read now, it will certainly be read by future generations studying the fall of the United States.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Mark Levin, who worked in the justice department of the Regan administration, does a real service for us by reviewing not only a few of the colorful men and women who have served on the court, but also the evolution of judicial review and the way politics has superceded the Constitution in many of the Court's decisions.  The fact is that we have a written Constitution and a process for changing the Constitution to prevent the kind of power grab the courts have made in recent decades.  Yet, because of the abdication of the legislative branch and, to a lesser extent, the executive, the courts today reign and rule.\n\nFor more than a generation the public has been mis-educated about the facts and meaning of Marbury v. Madison.  It is time to insist on a public discourse on these matters in order to put the role of the courts into a proper perspective.  This may seem like a change, since everyone living has been taught that the courts have the final say in our government.  This was not so prior to the mid-twentieth century and was never the intent of our Founders.\n\nOnce we see the Justices and judges for what they are and compare that to what they are supposed to be, we can begin removing the powers they should never have had.  We need to expend unceasing energy placing them back into their proper role and requiring them to uphold the oath each of them took to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThe author rightly focuses on current debates, only going back in history to provide context.  If Mr. Levin had included all the abuses of the Judiciary, the book would have had to be presented in multiple volumes.  He discusses the current debate in U.S. Courts about using opinions from FOREIGN courts and policies from NGOs in deciding cases.  This is so absurd that it is hard to take seriously how frightening and dangerous this trend really is.  This book helps every reader understand the reality and threat of this very clearly.\n\nMr. Levin also takes us through the follies and convolutions of judiciary thought on the continuing banishment of God from public discourse through judicial fiat, the manufacturing of privacy rights (only sometimes) to support abortion, the torturing of the 14th amendment in order to support (selective) reverse discrimination, providing rights for non-citizens and terrorists.  He recounts only some of the more egregious social policies legislated by a judiciary that sees itself as more socially advanced than the insufferable populace and their state legislatures.\n\nRemember, this is all much less about whether or not this or that policy is correct or not, or needed or not.  It is about the way the policy is being implemented, legislated, imposed by judges.  That was never their intended or rightful role in our government.  Our government is certainly amenable to change.  However, it is change brought about by persuasion of our fellow Citizens and mutually changing the laws.  Not by some small number of beings who deign impose their enlightened and more evolved views on us the benighted.  That is the very tyranny we threw off to claim our freedom.  We need to remember that and reorder our government to its proper balance.\n\nI particularly liked Mr. Levin's clear and forceful discussion of the curtailing of our first amendment free speech rights by our legislature (to protect incumbents) with the support of laughable court decisions.  Well, laughable if they weren't so tragic to the health of our public discourse.\n\nWe do need a broad public discourse on this and continue to demand of our legislatures that they honor their oath to protect and defend the entire constitution.  They should not only reign in their own political use of the judiciary to get what they failed to win at the ballot box, but they should be aggressive in putting the entire judiciary back in its place.\n\nNewt Gingrich's \"Winning the Future\" has a great discussion of this process as well.\n\nIf you want to read a more complete treatment of Judicial Review - Judicial Supremacy, I encourage you to read \"The People Themselves\" which provides a complete and scholarly, yet very readable, discussion of this vital topic.\n\nPlease, read this book and talk about it with everyone you know.  And don't be afraid to write your state and US representatives in order to make your views known on this most important issue.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "It's not such earth-shattering news that there is something awry about the precarious checks and balances upon which the three branches of the U.S. government are designed to keep an eye on each other. Author Mark Levin takes on the Supreme Court with emotional gusto and portrays the judicial arm of the government as a tyranny of monopolistic power threatening the very foundation of our constitution. He sees the Court evolving into a legislative agency rather than fulfilling its intended role as the interpreter of the laws. It's an intriguing premise to take a peek behind the black robes (though not as funny as the nude centerfolds of the justices in Jon Stewart's \"America: The Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction\") but one often caught in hyperbole, no surprise since Levin is by profession, a talk show host who mistakes such tactics as passionate discourse.\n\nTo his credit, the author does bear the weight of thoughtful research when he looks, for example, at the Supreme Court's willingness to abrogate the First Amendment through upholding the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act. He provides some compelling evidence of how the Court has overstepped its bounds on many occasions, in particular, by expanding the power of the federal government vis--vis several states to enforce certain rulings. The author feels this encroaching sense of power has ignited issues such as abortion, immigration, civil rights for terrorists, religious liberty, affirmative action, pornography and election law, beyond what would have made sense within the Constitution's framework.  But the stacked deck approach he takes, dubbing the Court \"radicals in robes\", seems to oversimplify what he feels are the justices' directive to impose their policy preferences on society.  Levin should be commended for undertaking such a worthy effort with such vigor, and I have to give credit to him for explaining why certain cases should not have happened in light of what the Constitution says. I just wish he spent less time on what he perceives to be the problem with the current Court and more time on what he feels should remedy it. The book could have resonated with me much more if he was more solution-driven in his approach.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "Strung out on opium and falsely imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit Viscount Lord Ryder Blackwood is embittered and doesn't see a way out of his predicament. Losing hope and not caring if he lives or dies, he's surprised when someone finally comes forward to clear his name. Unbeknownst to him while incarcerated he's accrued a wife, a woman he's sure is inline with his thieving aunt and cousin. Jessie is an innocent pawn in the lunacy of her stepfather. Marrying a man she thought knew of their arrangement, she's unprepared for his disbelief and anger. Jessie made sure at least his family fortune wasn't ravished in the same way his home has been, but feels all her efforts will be in vain due to the lord's dependency on drugs and alcohol. An unlikely pair will have to overcome the torment that comes when your mind and body are ensnared by chemical enslavement.\n\nI think sometimes modern individuals forget drugs have been an issue for hundreds of years. The Viscount's Addiction is a prime example of how even the strongest of spirits can be broken when hopelessness occurs. Jessie and Ryder are both victims of their circumstances but while Ryder has decided to drown in his sorrows Jessie has taken her situation and maintained not only her physical innocence but her morality. This historical effort from Scottie Barrett is memorable and provides a dramatic way to past the time on a wintry day.\n\nIndy\nreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed", "label": "good review"}

I loved how the book opens with him in prison and it's not clear where things go from there. It gave me a sense that this was not going to be the average predictable historical romance. Ryder had a lot of depth to his character and I could feel his pain. When Jessie comes into the picture, their chemistry explodes and the sex is off the charts hot. At about 3/4 of the way in, I thought things dragged a bit as they were both reluctant to disclose their feelings for each other and their lack of communication became frustrating. Hence the 4 star review. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed this entertaining tale. This is my second Scottie Barrett novel but it will not be my last!", "label": "good review"}

He wonders how this illegal marriage came about while he was in prison and he feels that he cannot trust Jessie for that she must be a gold digging liar, but he cannot resist the pull his body has to her and he cannot resist the temptation of consuming everything about her. Ryder does have a horrible addiction to opium that he acquired in prison, though it was hard to see Ryder's addiction to opium play out and through the struggles he had with it I felt myself wanting him to overcome this addiction.

{"words": "This review is for \"Blair,\" since there are multiple colors listed on the same page.\n\nI really like nailpolish colors like this.  I have quite a selection in the oxblood/deep red/wine/reddish purple family, including glitters, cremes, shimmers, etc.  So I expected to love the color of this even before I bought it!\n\nI find the color in the bottle looks pretty similar to the color you see when it dries (and also to the image on the screen on the computer I'm currently using).  So you know what you'll be getting.  I'd say this had cool/purplish undertones for a red, it's really more of a wine color.  It has a subtle shimmer and looks really nice with a high-shine topcoat (I used one from Seche Vite).\n\nThis went on more smoothly than most polishes I've used lately (over an OPI base coat).  It dried quickly.  I used two coats to get it fully opaque, but depending on your preferences, you might be able to get by with one thick coat.  I got only one tiny bubble that you can hardly even see (I've had much worse bubbling problems with other polishes).  So far, I don't have any shrinking or chips although that might change when I clean house later tonight.  But about 18 hours after application, it still looks nearly perfect.  I'd say this was one of the better-performing Zoya polishes I've used in that regard.  (I have quite a few of them.)", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "The cover on my last issue featured Sofia Vergara in Agent Provocateur's black lingerie - and I still didn't bother to renew my subscription. It was too little, too late for a magazine that initially drew my interest as I smarter alternative to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Maxim/dp/B002IYSZBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Maxim</a>&nbsp;and a more coffee-table friendly alternative to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Playboy/dp/B001UJICAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Playboy</a>. Alas, after a one-year subscription, Esquire failed to capture me.\n\nI purchased my Esquire subscription with the same expectations I had for&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/GQ/dp/B00005N7QI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">GQ</a>, magazines known more for their abundant advertisements and cologne samples than for an unique, interesting take on men's interests. Esquire pushes well beyond my limits. The April 2012 edition (my last) makes a perfect example. The table of contents appears on page 25; advertisements packed between it and the cover:\n\nBvlgari\nGiorgio Armani\nErmenegildo Zegna\nDolce & Gabbana\nCalvin Klein\nWoodford Reserve\nLincs DC & Co\nNewport Beach Film Festival\nHugo Boss\nLuminox\nMoontower Comedy & Oddity Fest\nBuick\n\nThat's 24 pages of advertisements before you reach the first editorial copy. And if you think that's an unfair representation, let me share that the next 20 pages includes ads for JC Penny, Tommy Hilfiger, Triumph, Canali, Salvatore Ferragamo, Ford, Breitling, Hickey Freeman, Gucci and Citibank. Within the next 20 pages, there are two more pages thinly spread with a table of contents, a staff listing, and only four pages of content, one of which carries the staff listing jump.\n\nSo, in the first 45 pages of Esquire, there are less than four pages of actual content.\n\nOnly one article, \"Miracle\" by Craig Davidson, was of the quality that I'd come to expect from Esquire. The nine-page piece (two pages serve as bloated title art) explores the medical advancements of synthetic hormones to delay age-related conditions.\n\nThe Sofia Vergara cover garners two thumbs up from me. However, only three more pictures of her appear in the magazine. Three! That's reason enough to fire an editor, maybe a couple. I can only take so many pictures of shaggy, bearded, brooding men hawking shoes, watches and cologne. If you are going to put Sofia Vergara on the cover, at least have the decency to treat your readers to a longer layout, at least a half dozen pages.\n\nWhat's left is a choppy, increasingly juvenile collection of short articles and humor that illustrates how much Maxim and the other Laddies infected the entire men's magazine industry. The April 2012 edition included these one-page, puddle skippers:\n\nLevi's made and crafted\nMad Men's fifth season\nNew books by Stephen King and John Grisham\nHow picky are sperm banks?\nKeyboard shortcuts we need\n\nIn summary, Esquire is at the 1977 Elvis stage of life. I look back on the old issues with the same fondness I once held for Men's Health, Playboy and GQ. For a magazine approaching its 80th anniversary, Esquire needs some of those synthetic hormones to ward off its bloated visage and marked decline in quality features. Someone forgot being entertaining and smart are not mutually exclusive. Simply, today's Esquire is shallow and Maxim-esque.\n\nRating: Two stars.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Great magazine to give as a gift to someone who likes to read. I bought as a stocking stuffer at Christmas time.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Bottom-Line: When all is said and done I have to admit that I enjoy reading \"Esquire Magazine;\" who knows the magazine just might make me a better man!\n\nThe world of men's magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, \"Esquire\" magazine stands out as a periodical with substance, style and intellect, but at the same time is not afraid to feature a beautiful woman on the cover and within it glossy folds.\n\n\"Esquire Magazine,\" whose tag line is Man at His Best, was founded in 1933 and is published monthly by the venerable Hearst Corporation.  The magazine has a long history of featuring noted authors of their day, including Malcolm Muggeridge, William F. Buckley, and Truman Capote among other notables.\n\nHowever, \"Esquire Magazine\" is known and has been known as much for its artsy cover designs as its high-brow content and had given birth to a few notable art designer careers.  To this date the cover of \"Esquire,\" remains a work of art with big bold colors, and larger than life personas framed by flowing text.  The covers alone rival another venerable men's magazine--Playboy--in style and sex appeal.  The only difference is that \"Esquire\" gives equal deference to men on its covers, though they--thankfully--are not shown in various stages of undress.\n\n\"Esquire Magazine\"--a monthly publication, is a striking combination of the trivial and useful information, from its (mostly) useless monthly column The Guide to Sex to the interesting 10 Things You Don't Know about Women, written by a different female celeb, which I find somewhat useful.  The first third of the magazine is devoted to these little nuggets of information designed to help craft a better man.\n\nIn addition to the monthly Features section, Esquire also includes a rather lengthy and engaged celebrity interview; this month it is Angelina Jolie, two months ago it was the delectable Halle Barry.  Some might find these sort of celeb-driven interview trite, given the massive print and video coverage already afforded far too many so-call celebrities, but there is something to be learned from the oft-candid gab-fests with the stars.\n\nBut, \"Esquire Magazine\" because it is a men's magazine, does pay homage to barely dressed, well crafted (meaning air-brushed) women within it covers, just not so many as, say Maxim or Stuff, but they are well represented.  And \"Esquire Magazine\" in not above objectifying women as its yearly Sexist Woman Alive anointment clearly shows.  The reigning queen Scarlett Johansson is set to give up her crown soon to a new winner, so the magazine has started drooping clues as to who the next winner will be; it is up to us to figure out who before the moniker is bestowed upon another blonde-haired, blue eyed American beauty; women of color need not apply it seems.\n\nHowever, If the two latter magazines take the stance that the way to a man's mind it through his eyeballs and groin, \"Esquire Magazine\" appeals to a higher sensibility hinting that men might just learn a thing or two from the fairer sex, thus elevating the intellectual discourse between the genders.\n\nAnd great writing is still at the forefront of the magazines agenda.  If the first third of the rag is dedicated to the snippet, the later half is devoted to lengthy articles, with little or no commercial interruption (YES!).  Excerpts from novels written by both males and females find a home within \"Esquire Magazine\".  And authors, both known and unknown grace the pages.\n\nBut there are investigative articles as well, which I less compelling but, but welcome nonetheless.  A recent article featured a man who is now in charge of security at a major nuclear power plant in the U.S. who used to work for Blackwater as a paid gun for hire.  The article portrays the man as something more than a macho ape with a gun for hire; he is given a decidedly human face and heart, which I found oddly engaging.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen all is said and done I have to admit that I enjoy reading \"Esquire Magazine\".  When I first picked one up years ago I was convinced that there was nothing for me within its (somewhat) high brow pages, but I have come to enjoy the magazines style and substance, though I must admit that most of the advertising is not designed for someone of my limited financial station; yes I make a good living, but little of my current income is disposable enough to by a $500.00 wrist watch even if I wore them, which I don't.\n\nBut if you are banned (for whatever reason) from reading the quintessential male magazine, Playboy, \"Esquire Magazine\" comes in close second, followed by GQ.  If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, filled with those little tidbits in life only men can appreciate, but also brings a healthy infusion of intelligent to its well written and information pages, Esquire Magazine might be for you.  Now that I have started my subscription ($10.00 for a year from Magazines.com), I doubt I will let it lapse, it is turning out to be just that good. And who knows \"Esquire Magazine\" just might make me a better man!", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This magazine is great and has a lot of good information and tips. It is more classy and sophisticated than the otherwise \"trashy\" Maxim magazine. Better yet, you will not be embarrassed to have Esquire on the table when family is over. And, the best part, this magazine is very enjoyable by all ages and both genders. Love it! The price is great!", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I am giving Esquire four stars because it is so cheap, and occasionally features well written award winning articles. In general, each issue is filled with ads that serve to subsidize the cost of the magazine to subscribers. Which is why I am getting this magazine at less than $0.40 an issue, which doesn't even cover postage. I subscribe to Esquire for the occasional article that is insightful and illuminating. You get what you pay for.\n\nPros\n- Cheap\n- Literary Tradition\n- Occasionally features well written articles\n\nCons\n- Full of Ads\n- Most articles are boring", "label": "good review"}

Therefore, I rely on three magazines to keep \"frumpy\" at arm's length: People Style Watch, Lucky, and InStyle. What these three magazines have in common is their visual approach to fashion: you will not find there silly articles on global affairs written by teenage interns. Instead, you will be treated to lots of pictures of fashionable style setters not only on the red carpet, but, MOST IMPORTANTLY, in street clothing. I believe these to be much more meaningful to an average Earthling such as myself then the overstilized artsy fashion photos one finds in the likes of VOGUE...\n\nI also like the fact that the magazine identifies the brands. I may not be able to afford everything, but on many occasions I have been able to make prudent additions to my wardrobe based on the editors' recommendations, and/or acquire more affordable article based on the \"original\".\n\nFours stars only, as I would like to see more fashions specifically for the 30's/40's set.", "label": "good review"}

Fashion, decorating and make-up suggestions are all normal brands at normal stores (Target, Macy's, Gap, Walmart, Old Navy, LLBean, Pier 1)\n6. Little fluff and most of the ads that are in there have coupons\n7. Safe enough to leave on the table around kids (no kinky stuff)\n8. Just enough family and kid-fun info but majority appeals to women so you don't feel so mommyish readying it\n9. No gossip or celebrity picture.  I don't buy anything that pays scummy paparazzi.\n10.  I can read it from beginning to end the first day and still go back to the issue multiple times thru the month for decorating, fashion and recipe ideas.  Great value\n\nI normally don't write long reviews but this is truly a great magazine!\n\nEDIT:  7/7/09 - BEFORE you order this magazine PLEASE look over the time it takes to get your first one in the mail.  Amazon states it takes 6 to 10 weeks from the day you purchase right at the top of the page.  All the 1 star reviews are from idiots who are mad their magazine hasn't come yet and \"it's been a whole month!\"  Stop leaving poor reviews because it isn't All You's fault or Amazon's - it is your own fault for not reading the obvious print on how long it takes to arrive.  Be patient.  It is a great magazine and doesn't deserve the bad 1 star reviews for people's lack of common sense.\n\nEDIT: 7/5/13 - I still order and read this magazine every single month.  I think the content has stayed the same but I think there are a few less coupons than before.  The only place you can pick this magazine up in the stands is at Walmart.  And yes, it still takes a long time to get this magazine like every other magazine from Amazon.  You can get it a few weeks quicker going directly to their publishing department but I like the magazine subscription reminder thru Amazon as opposed to getting paper mail from publishers.

They also have shorter articles on travel, the Midwest life, discoveries, events worth writing for and reflections.  Even though this is a magazine that appeals to women more then men, it often has articles and features men might enjoy reading as well.

{"words": "You have to look at this magazine in comparison to the one that is ranked right above it in its category - The Economist.\n\nBoth magazines download every week and you have the content ahead of anyone who might be waiting for the physical hard copy.  You can be done with next week's magazine before the weekend starts.\n\nBoth have a fairly wide ranging look at the business world.  However, the Economist goes further in depth with regions that are not America.  There is a lot of content in the Economist, so much that it is almost hard to read cover to cover every week if you have other things you might want to read.\n\nBusinessWeek's brevity, in this light can be either a detriment or a selling point.  Most of the non-feature articles are around five hundred words.  There is even a greater way to save time, where the bottom of the article has a one-sentence synopsis called \"The Bottom Line\".  It is kind of reductive, but nice if you're pressed for time.\n\nA big drawback is the formatting.  There are no photos in BusinessWeek, nor are there any charts.  It is all text.  The Economist has some photos from the print edition, and as far as I know, all of the charts (Even if they are hard to read at times on the screen).\n\nThe selling point is price.  The monthly price is about 30% of that which the Economist is asking for.  As much as I like the Economist, I am keeping my subscription to Business Week because of the premium and the less time I need to spend, even though I am not entirely comfortable with my choice, it feels like the best one.", "label": "bad review"}

I love the coverage that Businessweek focuses on the emerging economies of China, and India.\n\nHopefully, the recent sale of Businessweek to Bloomberg will bring the same quality that I have come to expect from this magazine.\n\nPros\n- In-depth feature articles\n- Good summary of weekly news\n- Moderate viewpoint\n\nCons\n- Not as analytical or data driven as the economist", "label": "good review"}

It is a good light read for US business news, and if you aren't looking for great depth, might be a good choice.  For my money, I would rather pay up for the Economist and Fortune.\n\nUpdate - 2014 - I received a complementary subscription of Bloomberg Business Week and it is much improved over the version I reviewed 6 years ago.

All the 1 star reviews are from idiots who are mad their magazine hasn't come yet and \"it's been a whole month!\"  Stop leaving poor reviews because it isn't All You's fault or Amazon's - it is your own fault for not reading the obvious print on how long it takes to arrive.  Be patient.  It is a great magazine and doesn't deserve the bad 1 star reviews for people's lack of common sense.\n\nEDIT: 7/5/13 - I still order and read this magazine every single month.  I think the content has stayed the same but I think there are a few less coupons than before.  The only place you can pick this magazine up in the stands is at Walmart.  And yes, it still takes a long time to get this magazine like every other magazine from Amazon.  You can get it a few weeks quicker going directly to their publishing department but I like the magazine subscription reminder thru Amazon as opposed to getting paper mail from publishers.  Earth friendly and easier to remember.", "label": "good review"}

This magazine (Midwest Living) focuses on living in the Midwest but has articles and features that may be of interest to anyone no matter where you live in the U.S.  I just finished reading the June/July 2015 issue which had some interesting and informative articles and departments.  The following is just an example of the material in this magazine:\nNotes of the North was about the beautiful music, art, and wilderness of the Apostle Islands in Bayfield, Wisconsin. Flower power showed some of the floral fabrics, wall papers and accessories that brighten up a home. Viva Mexican night gives 14 delicious recipes you can spice up your dinner time.  They also have shorter articles on travel, the Midwest life, discoveries, events worth writing for and reflections.  Even though this is a magazine that appeals to women more then men, it often has articles and features men might enjoy reading as well.  It is also reasonably priced at about $2.00 an issue when you subscribe.\n\nIf you live in the Midwest you might want to check out this magazine.\n\nRating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J.

{"words": "You have to look at this magazine in comparison to the one that is ranked right above it in its category - The Economist.\n\nBoth magazines download every week and you have the content ahead of anyone who might be waiting for the physical hard copy.  You can be done with next week's magazine before the weekend starts.\n\nBoth have a fairly wide ranging look at the business world.  However, the Economist goes further in depth with regions that are not America.  There is a lot of content in the Economist, so much that it is almost hard to read cover to cover every week if you have other things you might want to read.\n\nBusinessWeek's brevity, in this light can be either a detriment or a selling point.  Most of the non-feature articles are around five hundred words.  There is even a greater way to save time, where the bottom of the article has a one-sentence synopsis called \"The Bottom Line\".  It is kind of reductive, but nice if you're pressed for time.\n\nA big drawback is the formatting.  There are no photos in BusinessWeek, nor are there any charts.  It is all text.  The Economist has some photos from the print edition, and as far as I know, all of the charts (Even if they are hard to read at times on the screen).\n\nThe selling point is price.  The monthly price is about 30% of that which the Economist is asking for.  As much as I like the Economist, I am keeping my subscription to Business Week because of the premium and the less time I need to spend, even though I am not entirely comfortable with my choice, it feels like the best one.", "label": "bad review"}

Each issue features one or two articles that provide insight, and new idea into forces that will change the business environment. I love the coverage that Businessweek focuses on the emerging economies of China, and India.\n\nHopefully, the recent sale of Businessweek to Bloomberg will bring the same quality that I have come to expect from this magazine.\n\nPros\n- In-depth feature articles\n- Good summary of weekly news\n- Moderate viewpoint\n\nCons\n- Not as analytical or data driven as the economist", "label": "good review"}

It is a good light read for US business news, and if you aren't looking for great depth, might be a good choice.  For my money, I would rather pay up for the Economist and Fortune.\n\nUpdate - 2014 - I received a complementary subscription of Bloomberg Business Week and it is much improved over the version I reviewed 6 years ago.  Much closer to the Economist - which is still my \"go to\" magazine.  I have therefore upgraded the review to 4 stars to reflect the improvement and encourage the BW editors to keep up the good work.", "label": "good review"}

Gone are all the great articles about meditation, healthy mind-body, different yoga-related philosophies, etc.\n\nI wound up subscribing to \"Mindful Magazine\" instead and it's more of what I was looking for.

{"words": "First off.  I ordered this for $5 from amazon while on special.  Takes about 2-3 months to get the first issue (which it clearly states when ordering).\n\nThere are some interesting articles, many intended for beginners.  Since the vast majority of yoga students are beginners, they are definitely hitting the target market.  But being a very advanced practitioner, I wasn't expecting too much from this magazine.  I was slightly surprised though from several of the peripheral articles.  That is, the articles not about the actual physical activity of yoga, but about the mind and lifestyle associated with.  Things like adding Feng Shui to your abode or tips for vacationing or improving wellness.\n\nThat is why I actually give it some good stars.  The one less star than perfect is because this magazine has TONS of ads.  Lots.  And many are for companies and products that many yoga students could care less about... Though some are of interest.  I don't mind some Lululemon and Gaiam ads, but flip through one issue and you see that nearly 2/3 of the magazine is ad space...  But I guess that's where the money is.  Not in the $5 to $15 per year subscriptions.\n\nAlso of note:  9 issues.  Not 12 for a year.  Just fyi.\n\nIf you know what you're getting with this periodical, then it's a good thing to have.  Just don't be shocked that the poses mentioned are pretty basic, or some of the fundamentals are covered over and over again.  It's meant for the beginner.  I have a couple of books that have more advanced information and those are what I use for improving my alignment in poses:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Athlete-s-Guide-to-Yoga-An-Integrated-Approach-to-Strength-Flexibility-and-Focus/dp/193403004X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Athlete's Guide to Yoga: An Integrated Approach to Strength, Flexibility, and Focus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Optimal-Health-for-a-Vibrant-Life-A-30-Day-Program-to-Detoxify-and-Replenish-Body-and-Mind/dp/1451548435/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Optimal Health for a Vibrant Life: A 30-Day Program to Detoxify and Replenish Body and Mind</a>.

{"words": "\"Food Network Magazine\" is my favorite culinary periodical. I am a fan of some of the celebrity chefs on Food Network, and this magazine is good on covering them in interviews and showcasing their recipes and cooking techniques. The magazine is very hefty and is printed on high quality glossy stock; that combined with the first class photography inside makes readers motivated to improve their cooking game and try their hand at new dishes and methods.\n\nI'm a dedicated follower of Alton Brown, whose culinary creativity and methodologies are singularly amazing, and also love the food from Bobby Flay, Michael Symon, and Aarn Snchez (whose knowledge and use of spices and particularly peppers is without peer.) Honestly there are few of the chefs who I don't enjoy hearing from, and most issues are worth a solid cover to cover perusal. I like the visual elements of the magazine: the \"Recipe Index\" has a page number and photo of all the dishes in an issue, and the \"Star Search\" feature has pictures of the celebrities in an issue with the pages they appear on. There are many routine features that I love, but none as much as the well-illustrated recipes section. I particularly enjoy the \"You Asked\" section where the star chefs answer reader questions: sometimes these tips can prove extremely useful.\n\nI gave the magazine five stars though there are a few things less than perfect. The magazine, like most similar publications, has a ton of advertising, though much of it is relevant and unobjectionable. Each issue has a theme: normally this theme is a welcome centering device, but sometimes it is excessive as are some of the features. A recent edition had more coverage of deviled eggs than anyone could ever want (and I like deviled eggs,) while some of the articles are of little practical use (I'm not interested in Penn Jillette's colorful kitchen, for instance, though I am sure some readers are.) Regardless of these quibbles, I still greatly enjoy \"Food Network Magazine\" and look forward to every new issue. I recommend it to cooks (of all experience levels) and fans of Food Network everywhere.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I have been subscribing to The Food Network Magazine,(FNM) for almost a year now.  Down through the years I have subscribed to several cooking magazines, and for one reason or another have eventually let them drop.  Every one I know, or have subscribed too were bi monthly magazines that mostly contained some cute little departments in them that were fun to read, but mostly a whole lot of recipes.  True recipe magazines aren't a bad thing if you enjoy just holding something in your hand the old fashioned way, but if its really recipes only your after, the online world is absolutely infested with huge sites where that is all they have and do.  I just never felt I got enough beyond the recipes in the other magazines to ever make them worth keeping...\n\nFNM is a whole different periodical.  Its more like a trade journal of the food network, and culinary industry in general.  All done in a nice easy, fun to read, colorful and entertaining style.  Its like being on the inside of the food channel, back stage where for most of us that love the food network, always wish we could be in any event.  I think its pretty much safe to say if you love the food network, or just love cooking, you will find this magazine immensely entertaining.  Its full of behind the scenes glimpses of the personalities, sets, production, and operation of all the shows we love to watch, as well as interviews, informative information, and a good dose of humor as well.  It also has a nice set up of every month departments where you can ask your questions, get reviews on new books and equipment, and get loads of tips on just about every kind if food or cooking that you can imagine.  Finally, despite what some other reviewers have expressed here as it being short on recipes, FCM still packs a good number of them into every issue, (even more starting about 7 issues ago). They also spread the recipes out as to dispensing them pretty evenly among all the different stars that have shows.  Therefore if you favor a certain personality or show, you will find something from them regularly.  Personally one thing I love about this magazine as to its take on recipes is that they don't seem to concentrate so much of sweets and desserts.  Seems like every magazine and cookbook I have ever owned deems is necessary to have a whole section devoted to just desserts.  I much prefer more in the way of recipes for real food, which FNM does a good job of delivering.  The recipes I have actually gotten around to trying from its pages have all turned out to be delicious, as you might expect.\n\nLastly there are two others things worth mentioning if your considering subscribing to this FNM, and doing it here on Amazon.  The first is that FNM is published 10 times a year, or 3 more times than all other cooking magazines I know.  I like the fact that it comes every month but two.  (And trust me, this is a slightly over size, thick magazine, not just a thin thumb through).  Finally, I originally subscribed to this magazine through one of those subscription service sites on the web that claims to always have the lowest prices around.  I paid $18 for my subscription, and as of this writing it is still going for that price online, while here on Amazon its currently $15.  A pretty good savings for what it is.  I not only highly recommend this fun entertaining and informative magazine, but I also recommend you buy it right here on Amazon. I certainly will be when my subscription renewal comes around. I am immensely enjoying my Food Network Magazine, and I really think you will like it too...", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I saw this movie years ago and recorded it off TV.  After many years and a format transfer, my copy was in pretty poor shape.  Happy to have a DVD copy to enjoy (as I did last night).\n\n\"The Crossing\" tells the story of General George Washington's preparations to attack the Hessian soldiers (in service to Britain) at Trenton on Christmas 1776.  The movie highlights the disagreements and personality conflicts between Washington and some of his key commanders, and the challenges of pulling off such a revolutionary attack.\n\nThe movie benefits from many quality actors and from its tight focus on the build-up to the crossing, the crossing, fight, and immediate aftermath.  I don't think I'd known until watching this that Washington's men retreated back across the river after the attack.\n\nMy only real quibble with the video quality is that you can tell where the commercial breaks were from the original TV production airing.  I would think that they could have edited the video together a little bit better so that those weren't as noticeable or else didn't exist at all on the DVD.  It wasn't so bad that I couldn't enjoy the movie, but it was noticeable at least a few times.\n\nI liked Jeff Daniels from his work in Ted Turner's Gettysburg/Gods and Generals and like him here as well.  As with the two movies I've just mentioned, this one gives little bits of info on what happened to some of these historical figures after this battle.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "\"The Crossing\" is a surprisingly well-done TV historical drama based on General George Washington's iconic crossing of the Delaware River on Christmas night, 1776.  The moment, and the movie, focus on a low point in American fortunes during the Revolutionary War.  Washington's Continental Army had been driven in defeat from New Jersey by the British Army, and faced dissolving altogether as enlistments expired at the end of the year.  Washington daringly staked everything on a surprise counter-attack that caught the enemy sleeping off the holiday in Trenton in the early hours of 26 December.  Washington's high stakes gamble saved the Continental Army, and perhaps the young United States, from extinction.\n\nJeff Daniels is very credible as the stern and determined Washington.  The supporting cast is also quite good, especially Sebastian Roche as the tough-minded General John Glover from Massachusetts, now unfortunately largely forgotten in history, whose Marblehead fishermen rowed the Army across an ice-choked river.  The production values and the attention to detail should easily satisfy most viewers.  It would be hard not to be caught up in the drama of the situation.  Recommended.", "label": "good review"}

While it is a serious, well-filmed story on General Washington's most challenging times during the war, with plenty of drama built into it, it is very much a factual masterpiece, more than adequately supported at the conclusion by a summary of the lives of the individuals who were most prominently featured in the story.  The film carefully built up enduring the dire situation at Valley Forge into culminating with Washington's famed \"Crossing of the Delaware,\" no mean logistics feat at the time, and the surprise taking of the British forces at Trenton\n\nPerhaps the most powerful aspect of the film is Jeff Daniels' portrayal of George Washington, during which he once again showed his versatile thespian abilities.

{"words": "December 1776: The Revolution thus far, was a disaster.\n\nFor twelve months the first American patriots had endured very little success against the British, being out-classed and routed from the battlefield in almost every engagement. Desertion was rampant. Arms, ammunition, and rations were scarce. Only a small number of the Revolutionaries had any military experience.\n\nEven worse, as was usual in warfare until the 20th century, epidemic diseases were the major cause of casualties, with so many men living together in the open under unsanitary conditions. As if this wasn't bad enough, it was winter, and most of Washington's demoralized troops had only days left to their enlistment contracts.\n\nWith the Revolution on the verge of collapse, General Washington needed a victory, ...immediately.\n\nAt this point in American History, ...America, OUR nation, was dangerously close to never HAVING a history. This was, quite possibly, the most critical moment in the story of America. The man who signifigantly changed our national destiny at this moment in time, was George Washington.\n\nSo how did General Washington save the Revolution from collapse? The story is portrayed most excellently in this movie!\n\nGeneral Washington received intelligence that a regiment of German Hessian mercenaries had made winter-quarters in Trenton, New Jersey. The troops from Hess were considered amongst the very best of professional soldiers in Europe. They had already inflicted severe defeats upon the Revolutionaries earlier that year. It was a long shot, with what limited resources he had under his command, ...but Washington realized that he just might have a chance at a much-needed victory, ...if all went as planned. Surely he did not expect his operation to result in one of the most one-sided victories in military history!\n\nWashington made his proposal to his subordinates. Most of them were vehemently opposed to the operation, given all the factors involved. The weather was abyssmal, intense cold and freezing rain. To get to Trenton, they had to cross the Delaware River, which was already full of large chunks of ice, and a limited quantity of boats.\n\nDespite the various obstacles, they adapted, improvised, and overcame.\n\nThey moved their ragged, starving, inexperienced army across the water, marching all night, cold and drenched to the bone! Many of these fellows didn't have shoes. It rained most of the way. The gun-powder was too wet to fire their rifles and muskets. Only the artillery had dry powder, ...which they used to great effect.\n\nThis factor makes the nature of this victory at Trenton even more amazing:\nThe Revolutionary army fixed bayonets, and rushed the town, KILLING the much more proficient enemy at CLOSE-QUARTERS! The completely surprised Hessian troops had just spent the previous night drunkenly carousing and feasting on Christmas Eve. Not one of them expected to be impaled by bayonets in the morning! Not one Revolutionary soldier was killed or injured in the attack on Trenton! Needless to say, ...this victory had the desired result on American morale.\n\nThe man who delivered this Christmas Present to America was OUR Founding Father, ...George Washington!\nHe succeeded because he was assisted by REAL MEN who were determined to accomplish this mission.\n\nThe real signifigance of this movie:\nThere have been several moments in the history of America, at home and abroad, where the nation faced seemingly overwhelming enemies, and abyssmally dire circumstances. This film portrays one of the first of such incidents. REAL AMERICANS take action. They lock and load, fix bayonets, ...and by the grace of God force a glorious victory from what was presumed to be an \"inevitable\" defeat. Be thankful that we had a REAL AMERICAN in command on Christmas Day of 1776!", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I've read several histories of Washington and/or the Revolution, including \"Washington's Crossing\" by David Hackett Fischer - a very good book and surprisingly easy to read - and \"1776\" by David McCullough, which covers the Battle of Trenton in detail. This film - despite some revisionism - is an excellent portrayal of the crossing and the Battle of Trenton.  Jeff Daniels does a surprisingly good job of characterizing Washington's demeanor, patriotism and dedication to the \"Glorious Cause\", as most revolutionists of the time called our American Revolution. After all Daniels is not new to portraying historical military figures, having portrayed Joshua Chamberlain in \"Gettysburg\" and \"Gods and Generals\". In fact the acting by the entire cast is uniformly good throughout. Despite his dedication and patriotism, Washington had surprisingly little military experience before taking command and had to learn as the revolution evolved. Trenton was his first real battlefield success. Washington came very close to losing his army; and we came very close to losing the Revolution in 1776. It was mostly due to Washington's determination and daring that we were able to continue fighting instead of going down to an inglorious defeat. This movie does a good job of telling that story...it is an excellent film and an excellent history lesson. I think General Washington would have smiled and nodded in agreement after watching this.", "label": "good review"}

Despite the creative licence taken by the producers and writers, there is still much about this that is factual and the performances were impressive.

I don't think the Karl Marx fan club could have made a worse presentation of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. It was a ridiculous assault disguised in the form of a historical production.

Incorrect. There were four wounded one of whom, the most seriously wounded was a young lieutenant in the 3rd Virginia named James Monroe. Fifth president of the United States.

{"words": "Jeff Daniels had brought to life previously a great figure in American history by his masterful job as Joshua Chamberlain in 'Gettysburg'. In 'The Crossing' he takes on a even larger icon from the American past and pretty much knocks it out of the park. George Washington has always been one of my favorite historical characters, I think pretty highly of him. I think that he and his men were the glue that held the American Revolution together. Washington could have been a dictator but wasn't. His character and devotion to country are the stuff legends are made of.\n\n'The Crossing' finds Washington at a critical time when he is at low ebb after the humbling defeats around New York. The war effort is portrayed in a very unromantic life. This was a war that America lost more battles than it won. But Washington at Christmas 1776 had a ace up his sleeve and the rest as they say is history. Daniels dazzles as Washington and portrays him as a very human character and shows his great temper that Washington usually kept under wraps. His dry humor is also a nice touch. I also like the bringing to life of the nearly forgotten John Glover ,by Sebastian Roch, and the true bravery of his men and what they sacrificed for the cause without their efforts little would have been possible. Roger Rees also does a nice job as Washington's friend Hugh Mercer. Mercer was one of the ancestors of George S. Patton of World War II fame, for a little trivia.\n\nThe film captures the cold of winter well and is a DVD to watch in December-January when the leaves have fallen off the trees and you have a warm crackling fire inside. This film captures that tough winter well and the spirit of the men who remained and the great leader who led them in one great roll of the dice. I wish more films were made about our Revolution.\n\nThe DVD has good picture and sound plus an interesting little 'making of' the film as an extra.\n\nHighly recommended!", "label": "good review"}

Leading a small, discouraged, and cold and hungry American militia Army, Washington took on the finest soldiers in the world and won a great victory.  Had he not done so, the American revolutionary cause might well have failed.  History correctly records that it was George Washington whose inspired leadership won the Battle of Trenton.\n\nJeff Daniels does splendidly as George Washington, and the supporting caste is also quite good.

{"words": "I recently saw the HBO miniseries \"John Adams\" and was compelled to watch this movie for a different perspective on a portion of the same period.  Like most American schoolchildren, my familiarity with the crossing of the Delaware at Trenton was limited to the famous painting of that event which shows General Washington perched imperiously in the prow of a boat while being rowed through icy waters in the dead of night.  The reality was decidedly less cinematic; unfortunately, so is this made-for-television treatment.  Admittedly, I was spoiled by the superior production values of \"John Adams\" beside which this production pales.  In its favor, it does present a grittier version of life in the Continental Army than we are accustomed to seeing and does much to humanize the deified personage of its Supreme Commander.  But the production was hobbled by obvious budget constraints and prosaic camera work that make it look very like the TV project it was.  This decisive battle that turned the Revolution in the colonialists' favor is portrayed as little more than a skirmish between Washington's ragtag band of volunteers and a bunch of unsuspecting drunks.  Maybe in truth that's all it was, but the amateur look of this production does nothing to elevate the action into something a little more noble.  It appears that the fate of the Revolution hinged on little more than a brawl.  But it was a brawl the fledging nation desperately needed to win, and Washington is revealed as a crafty stratetician who was willing to risk all on a breathtaking gamble all others dimissed as insane.  The isolation of Washington's command is portrayed with numerous references to the utter lack of support for Washington from the very body that had authorized him to carry out this war.  Citizens of the Republic in the present day may take comfort (or not) in the knowledge that from its very earliest incarnation, the Congress honed its reputation as a bunch of blow-hard self-promoters who existed to endlessly debate but not to act.  Also shown is the in-fighting among Washington's generals, some of whom resented his authority and in some cases, plotted actively to undermine it.  As Washington, Jeff Daniels successfully gives the 'statue' flesh and bone.  He has a wonderful physicality for the role and looks every part the vigorous and devotion-inspiring leader in his prime.  More problematic is his delivery, which sounds too much of the contemporary Midwest (Daniels is a Michigan native) and not much at all like the 'gentleman from Virginia.'  In general, I am not in favor of American actors larding up their dialogue with distracting accents, but though Daniels looks great, he does not sound convincing as a Tidewater aristocrat.  In contrast to the mostly British supporting cast with their more elegant diction, Daniels is rough-hewn and out of his element.  He also delivers his lines very s-l-o-w-ly; one hardly thinks Washington, in the heat of battle for his life and the Republic would have been so laconic. The teleplay by Howard Fast (based on his novel of the same name) displays a tin ear for authentically colonial-sounding dialogue, with many 20th century anarchronisms creeping in, and it presents the greatest obstacle for the actors.  Some worthwhile moments of content, but stylistically this could have done better by its subject.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "This movie was well done on every level. Good script, believable acting, excellent editing, great direction. I really liked the way Jeff Daniels portrayed Washington -- strong, understated and always believable. This movie works on every level and absolutely makes you feel like you're \"there\".  When a historical drama is able to make you feel transported back through time, it has succeeded.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "In all honesty, I expected this to be a so-so movie, however it turned out to be well done and very enjoyable. Jeff Daniels gives a wonderful performance as Washington and lifts the movie above the usual mediocrity of most made-for-TV-movies. All too often, actors are cast to play historic characters they just do not fit. In this case, not only does Daniels bear a passable resemblance to Washington, but he conveys the concern, insecurity, impatience, and determination the general admitted to feeling in his letters and correspondence.\n\nI enjoy reading about history, particularly the colonial/Revolutionary War period, and am generally wary of historical movies due to their tendency to fudge on facts. While I do not claim to be a historian, I found The Crossing to be pretty accurate. I do wish they had brought in more soldiers since the battle scene appeared somewhat skimpy in that regard.\n\nThe sets and costumes fit comfortably with the time setting, as does the language and mannerisms. The picture is clear and clean, not distorted by fading colors or other problems. While it was made for TV, I did not find the breaks to be annoyingly obvious as with some. The DVD includes extras, including an interesting account of the movie being made, as well as interviews. One part shows how stunt men made the battle scenes appear real- something younger viewers might enjoy.\n\nThere is neither objectionable language in the movie, nor any sexual themes. The battle is not particularly bloody or violent, but would probably be PG if rated. It would make a nice addition to a homeschool history curriculum as well as the family video library. I will certainly be watching this movie again.", "label": "good review"}

I am quite often too short on free time to watch a movie but 90 minutes works out real well.\n\nIf you are interested in The American Revolution, get a copy of The Crossing. If you like the film, buy the book. It gives you more detail. Then buy the book Washington's Crossing which very good, also.", "label": "good review"}

And Washington would be a hard character to play:  unless your Jeff Daniels.  He nails it and truly captured the heroic aspects of that great man.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "There are some historical inaccurracies in this film, to be sure. The Wikipedia entry for the movie has most of them. And like most movies dealing with any war, there are not enough men on the screen to portray the actual number of soldiers involved. Washington had more than 2000 troops when he went into Trenton, up against about the same number of Hessians. Of course, without computer-generated graphics, there's no way a made-for-television movie can portray that.\n\nI have to question the casting of Jeff Daniels as Washington. I know Washington was a flesh and blood person, but somehow Daniels (or perhaps the script he had to work with) does not communicate the gravitas that must have personified Washington. This was a man chosen practically unanimously by the Continental Congress to lead the army. Daniels does not come across as that sort of person.\n\nAlthough it is known that Washington had a temper, especially in extremis, most of the time Daniels' Washington comes across as merely petulant or even bitchy.\n\nThe dialogue between most of the characters seemed at times to be pretty anachronistic. American screenwriters should take a lesson from their British counterparts (Andrew Davies, for example) on how to write 18th Century dialogue that sounds authentic but not stilted or phoney.\n\nFinally, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. We watched it with our 7 and 9 year olds because they're studying the Revolution in school. We were dismayed by the bad language, sexual references and the over-the-top bloodletting. Why did the director think it a good idea to show closeups of bayoneting and swords going all the way through people? Showing it is one thing -- but closeups? C'mon! At least the DVD should have indicated what's in store so parents could be informed.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I give this film five stars despite some of its historical innaccuracies because it is so well produced.  Compare this movie to say something like Mel Gibson's PATRIOT and you have the difference between quality and trash!  The movie conveys the feeling and desperation of Washy's army on its last legs before striking back at Trenton.  Jeff Daniels does a spirted but probably false impression of Washy.  In reality the man was much more stiff and proper than is shown here.  Washy would never use such language in front of the common soldiers!  He rarely lost his temper as well, otherwise the famous tongue lashing of Charles Lee at Monmouth two years later would never have created such a sensation as it did.  Daniels makes Washy much more likeable to the modern audience, but is an flawed portrayal.\n\nThe production value of this film is first-rate.  Obviously period re-enactors were used and their dedication to the hobby shows in the correct formations, drills, etc.  The brief skirmish at the beginning with the British probably did not happen so close to the Delaware like that.  Also, the uniforms for the British appear off somehow.  They look like an earlier period, not the 1770s.  Still, it works.  The Hessians are well portrayed, although it would have provided variety if some Musketeer's with their tri-corn hats were shown.  Not all of Rall's men were Grenadiers and Fusiliers!\n\nAmerican losses were actually 2 dead from the march, and 4 wounded from the fight, including Hamilton and Monroe, the latter a future US President!  I don't know why the movie did not convey this.  The effects of Knox's artillery seems also much exaggerated.  Solid shot and cannister was used, not explosive shells as shown here.  Most films on this period fail to show artillery accurately in that regard.  Still, the acting and mood of the film are right on the mark which makes it easily the best Rev War production out there. Too bad it did not go further to show Washy's next great triumph at Princeton where a small British detachment gave him a much harder run for his money.  Still, what we have here is a nice concise work that comes close to converying the actual history of the event.  This is more than most Hollywood productions do these days.  Let's hope future movie producers draw upon this movie for inspiration rather than the PATRIOT and others like it.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I purchased this DVD after seeing it on TV. It goes into detail on the true crossing of the Delaware by Washington and his troops during the crucial battle of Trenton, a turning point in the revolutionary war.

{"words": "Unlike The Patriot which was purely made for propaganda purposes, The Crossing, follows a much more pragmatic, realistic, and in effect a more truthful account of events during the American War of Independence (1775-1783).  The film brings to the screen George Washington's first victory during the American Revolution: The Battle of Trenton.\n\nIt is December 1776 and the Continentals have yet to score a victory against the British.  Chased by government forces, the rebels find themselves exhausted on the banks of the Delaware river with General George Washington remaining Commander-in-Chief, but of the now remnants of what used to be the Continental Army (once numbering 20,000, now at 2,000 and dwindling).  Subsequently, Washington is faced with yet another difficult choice: does he camp for the winter and hope that he will still have his rank and an army spring come, or does he surprise-attack the city of Trenton, which is in the hands of 1200 crack German troops from Hessen?\n\nThe Crossing provides valuable insight into a very important period of American (and British) History. Specifically:\n\nWe get a taste (though a very light one) of the different attitudes and mentality of English North American colonists during the war e.g. when the foundry's owner refused to let the Continentals use his boats (before they were in turn confiscated).\n\nMoreover, we get to see or hear about, the double-crossing generals such as General Lee that allowed himself to be caught... and yet not so much about the merchants, farmers, and politicians that supported whichever side the wind happened to be blowing in, always in search of profit and personal gain, which another film, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, portrays so well.\n\nThe clash between the Loyalist American English and the Continental American English is not really shown, just the one between the Continentals and the British along with their Hessen allies/mercenaries, which is nonetheless fascinating and very well presented throughout the film; but then so is the clash within the Continental side (the undermining, the personality clashes-Washington vs Gates and Lee etc, favoritism-the contingency plan in having Sullivan arrest Lee), as well as the problems between Congress and the Army (there are the subtlest of hints for the latter/Ral's sword sent to Congress).\n\nThere is also the brave admission (by G. Washington) that the Continentals lack public support (enlistment being at a minimum, while trying to keep their minutemen from deserting), and the important role that Washington played throughout the Revolution in keeping the Continentals \"alive,\" long enough for the French (1778), Spaniards (1779), and Dutch (1780) to enter the war against Great Britain, and win the war.\n\nTherefore, the movie successfully sheds light on aspects of American History that some would rather keep hidden \"under the carpet.\"\n\nAs a result, The Crossing, is a daring movie, which shatters more than a few misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding attitudes towards the War of Independence, and provides for historical truths, which had been suppressed for long years in the name of \"patriotism.\"\n\nThe only major setback is in relation to Jeff Daniels who is not that great in his role; Kelsey Grammer was a much better Washington in Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor.\n\nAs for the end where it states that: \"The records show that a total of 16,992 Hessians were brought to America to fight the colonists.\"  That should be \"...to fight the rebel colonists,\" not forgetting the Loyalists and the Neutrals made up approximately 1/3 each, of the total colonist populace.\n\nIn short, The Crossing is a movie definitely worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection.\n\nStrongly recommended, especially for History buffs, along with Revolution starring Al Pacino, and Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, starring Aidan Quinn and Kelsey Grammer. 4.5 Stars", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "There is an old debate as to which is truer: history or poetry.\n\nThe accuracy is surprising, considering that it was adapted from a novel written by an author who generally knows better than to let history get in the way of a good story. In this case, the bending of the facts, mostly in characterization of some of Washington's generals, was relatively restrained, and supplied conflict that was real, if not always attributed to the correct historical person. Thus, the literary license does not get much in the way of history. Many of the small details are correct to an exceptional degree. All the characters, whether historically accurate or not, are well portrayed as people of the time. There is enormous subtlety here.\n\nThis is a magnificent expression of the American situation at the time and place.\n\nWhich is truer, history or poetry?\n\nThe correct answer is: \"Yes.\"\n\nThis film is both.

{"words": "Every American should see this film.  They should see, in the dramatic way that a video makes possible , the sacrifices that these earlier people made to give us a free country.\nI have often marvelled at the patience and tenacity of Washington through those 7 long years of war.  This film emphasizes his tenacity and just plain \"toughness.\"  It also gives us a picture of those few common soldiers who stayed with him through bitter defeat and privation while the majority deserted or otherwise disappeared.  These few made the great difference.  And among these few were fewer still the fishermen from Marblehead who saved the Army in New York making possible the escape march to Valley Forge.  This same close-knit group of men made the difference again at The Crossing.  They knew how to handle boats actually making the crossing possible.\nAs you watch the film listen especially carefully to the conversations between General Washington (Jeff Daniels) and Col. John Glover (Sebastian Roche).  Col. Glover is the feisty, outspoken officer who often disagrees but who knows how to take orders.  He commanded the Marblehead fishermen without whom Valley Forge and the Crossing would never have taken place.\nIf you are interested get Howard Fast's \"The Unvanguished.\"  This book tells the story of the Marblehead fisherman in New York in detail.  Fast wrote The Crossing including this film script. With Fast's earlier New York battle background you will understand how the Army got into such a desperate situation and Washington's relationship and conversations with Glover in this movie will make all the more sense.  .\nThe acting is good to very good.  The script is very good.  The story moves along well.  The settings are realistic and well done.  This is no sacrifice. It is real entertainment.  But it could inspire you to a little sacrifice for your country should the need arises.", "label": "good review"}

Washington even had his doubts about whether some of his chief commanders would even follow orders.\nThe story of the crossing, the hanging in the balance of the war with Great Britain, and the attack on Trenton are all masterfully done.

{"words": "This is a made-for-TV movie produced by the A&E television network in 2001.  It was adapted from a novel by Howard Fast and I assume it is historically accurate.  It's about a defining moment in American history - that of George Washington crossing the Delaware River and attacking the well-trained German soldiers hired by the British, at Trenton, New Jersey.\nI recently visited a friend who lives in that area and walked across the bridge where George Washington made this historic crossing.  Of course there was no bridge back in 1776 on that cold December day -- just the dark and the cold and an ice-filled river.  The Continentals, which was what the Americans were called then, were losing the war. They had not won a battle since they declared independence six months before on July 4.  The troops were weary and starving.  It looked like the American Revolution was lost.\nBut Washington took a huge risk, and in his own quiet and determined way, made a decision that changed the course of history.  The scenes of the actual crossing were done in fog and shadow, as the boats moved towards the opposite shore.  But there were no scenes that looked like the famous painting with Washington standing in the front of the boat.  In this film, Washington was sitting throughout. Naturally, this made me re-think my own historical perceptions.\nJeff Daniels is cast as Washington, and I found myself very critical of his performance.  He seemed aloof and wooden and, even though there was constant danger, he never lost his cool, calm leadership abilities.  I understand, though, that this is exactly the kind of person that George Washington was. If this is true, then he did portray him well.\nBasically, though, even though there was some conflict between the various generals as well as a bit of bawdy language and some violent scenes of swordplay, the film never rose above that of a history lesson, one shown in classrooms or while visiting museums. I tend to like my drama more complex though, and for that reason this film, while well done, has to be viewed for what it is.  I therefore give it a modest recommendation.  It's certainly worthwhile seeing.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "My girlfriend and I enjoyed this film and felt as though we'd really seen George Washington.  The film begins in 1776 and ends with the conclusion of the surprise attack on Trenton.  This is one chapter of history we feel intimately acquainted with now.  Although it doesn't seem to have enjoyed a great budget and although it has just a hint of an educational taste to it, the Crossing seems far more historically relevant than films like Patriot or Pacino's Revolution.  Daniels displays incredible posture especially while riding a horse and as a passenger in a boat through all hours of the night and thus quietly impresses upon us the dignity of America's first and fearless leader.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This is a wonderfully done made-for-cable movie about George Washington and his famous victory at the Battle of Trenton in the winter of 1776.  Starring Jeff Daniels as General Washington, this film brings an important episode in American history vividly to life.  We see the broken remnants of the Continental army as it races to avoid capture following their defeats in New York.  The British, close on the heels of the retreating rebels, have written the Americans off as being on the verge of total surrender. Washington, tired and beaten, realizes that he must make one last attempt to achieve victory or all hope for the revolution will be lost.  Against the judgement of his officers, Washington prepares to launch a desperate offensive against a large force of Hessian troops occupying the town of Trenton, just across the Delaware River in New Jersey. The future of the new United States hangs in the balance as the rag-tag army bets all or nothing on this dangerous gamble.  Well written and with money well-spent, The Crossing is a dramatic telling of this important moment in American history, and one that I would recommend to teachers, students, and history enthusiasts alike.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "As with all movies based on historical fact, the yardstick for this movie should be the accuracy presented regarding the battle of Trenton. Based on my somewhat limited reading (Richard Kethchum's \"The Winter Soldiers\"), this movie delivers reasonably well. More so, the most truly important aspect of history movies, in my opinion, is the context and how well this given period is presented...in essence, how deeply does the viewer feel involved? This is the issue that makes this movie stand out. Watching this, I felt all the emotions that Washington appeared to go through (desperation, frustration, exhileration upon smashing the Hessians at Trenton...) and just  marveled at the \"period\" depiction. I really felt that this was what it was like in 1776 Pennsylvania and New Jersey (volunteers with no uniforms or warm clothes...some even without shoes in the dead of winter...). Washington's character was well played by Jeff Daniels as he portrayed the important leadership qualities that made him a legend and founding father. Daniels \"playing\" Washington also managed to come across as somewhat flawed (i.e. \"human\"...) while giving a semblance of Washington's major desperation. On the negative side, I'm not so sure that Colonel Glover's role was historically accurate, although it was also well acted. In summary, an excellent movie and one that should be viewed by anyone interested in the Revolution. Highest recommendation.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I often show \"The Crossing\" to my political science classes and invariably they are enthralled.  It is an intriguing, almost shocking film.  The most striking surprise is that Jeff Daniels pulls off a portrayal of the great Washington with humanism, determinism, unparalleled leadership, mixed with a little testiness and bawdiness - in sum, a man with flaws who took his life and his mission seriously, while winning the loyalty of his rag tag troops.\nWashington was somewhat wooden, which Daniels again plays well, because he took every aspect of his life with dead seriousness and a clear vision of the nation he almost single-handedly created.  Present at the creation of the new nation, commander in chief, he rallied his men at the battle of Trenton in December 1776, the subject of this film, avenging his early loss of New York City.\nThe inaccuracies in the film are of little consequence since its essence is Washington.  His audacious crossing of the treacherous Delaware on Christmas eve in the depth of night, completely surprising battle-hardened, but hung-over Hessians, helped turned the tide of the war at a time when America's victory teetered on disaster.  Daniels creates a man, not a myth, giving him just the right amount of stiffness and caring for his men, and a determination that would win the very long war.\nJames Kidnie as the Hessian Colonel Rall is the perfect foil to Washington.  As the attack rages, he meticulously dresses himself and then panics at the American onslaught, hardly believing his eyes.  Director Harmon's pacing is plodding at times, but the crossing itself is full of suspense, the battle scenes more than passably exciting.  The cinematography and supporting cast are adequate. But the star of this film is Daniels. In sum, a fine A&E production well worth seeing.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "The Crossing is about a small action that became a pivotal point in the American Revolution, the American assault on German mercinary troops in Trenton, NJ.  What struck me was not the audacity of Washington attacking in the dead of winter, but the cooperation of his subordinates that was need to even make this action remotely possible.  This is an ensemble performance that centers around Washington but shows the synergistec effect that was needed to make the attack work.\n\nJeff Daniels is excellent as Washington pulling his dispirited troops together for a decisive action.  Washington was taking a great risk, maybe the biggest of his career; by making a winter attack.  Armies of this time, rarely, if ever, fought in the winter and Washington was going against convention by doing so.  He was also conducting an amphibious operation which is one of the hardest operations to perform in warfare.  Here the cooperation of others was critical.  If the men under Colonel John Glover were unable/unwilling to give their all, Washington might just as well have stayed in camp.  No boats, no action fairly well sums it up.  Washington's troops could have muddled through and affected a crossing, but the element of surprise, I am sure would have been lost and no surprise meant a harder and more doubtful battle.  Glover is the true unsung hero of the battle and it is good to see him recognized as such.\n\nThis film abounds in small points.  The depiction of the Pennsylvania German troops in Washington's command is well done. The state of mind of Washington's troops, ofter overlooked, is shown in great detail.  The use of period sites also was a big plus in the making of this film.\n\nIn all, I found this one of the best films about Washington's attack on Trenton and one that gives a new impression of the compexity in executing this battle.  This film should be in the library of every person with an interst in early America.", "label": "good review"}

Sebastian Roche as Col. Glover is wonderful. The rest of the cast were well chosen.\nOne of the most charming scenes is between two of the common soldiers trying to stay warm and dry in a small tent. They discuss the merits of smoking corn silk vs. cow dung in their clay pipes. They are very young and very human\nAnyone interested in the history of the Revolutionary War will find that this movie brings the struggle alive, depicting the officers and soldiers as men.

Jeff Daniels  portrays a superb George Washington, who was at times very impatient and  hot tempered.

While President Clinton did offer a near-apology for our decades of funding and organizing Guatemala's dirty war that killed 200,000 people, our corporatocracy continues to exploit the region and to wage economic warfare via NAFTA, CAFTA and the World Bank.\n\n\"Men With Guns\" beautifully shows all who care the sort of brutal madness that has been taking place in Central America.  I've shared this film with Guatemalan immigrants I know, and they confirm the suffering they endured at the hands of our proxy forces.  These US taxpayer funded troops wiped out Guatemalan villages in the same way the Nazis wiped out Russian villages.  It's such a disgrace that it happened, and that so few Americans know about it.  This film offers us a tool to raise awareness, and civic groups like Global Exchange and Madre offer us opportunities to act in solidarity with the victims of US foreign policy.\n\nI'd also recommend books by Nobel Peace Prize-winner Rigoberta Menchu (who, predictably, had a Yale professor conduct a campaign to cast doubt on her credibility - a standard psy-op tactic of our military establishment) and the DVD documentary, \"When the Mountains Tremble.\"\n\nAlso see \"Guatemala: Never Again!\", the official report of the human rights office of the archdiocese of Guatemala.

The shift in his life is caused by the death of his wife. He sets out in spite of his family not wanting him to leave. The aging doctor first encounters one his former students, now a drug dealer, using the same drugs he taught him to cure others, he is now using them for ill purposes. His journey has only begun and he finds many more dissapointments along the way. This is a beautiful film that is allegorical, historical, contemporary  and packed with messages for the viewer to interpret. In his quest to find his students he finds his country to be quite different from the view he had of it prior to his leaving the city. He encounters missing people  and tales of abductions from men with guns. The villagers call them white men with guns but are quick to say that the Indios are also now white men. Although the story takes place in an unnamed country, the parallels to Guatemala are clear. Having witnessed a corpse on the roadside while travelling in a bus (everyone gawked with little concern, as though it were a common sight) in Guatemala and seeing the treatment first hand of the military I am pretty sure this is where it is. However, this is unimportant as these occurences of hit squads and paramilitary goons, in cahoots with the military, are a frequent sight in many Latin American countries. Anyway, Dr. Fuentes picks up several people along the way to expand the tale. He picks up a \"liberation priest\" who abandons his collar and those who believed in him, a former military thug turned thief, an indigenous young woman who doesn't speak since she was raped by soldiers and a street-savy kid who is an orphan and Dr. Fuentes's guide. All represent the society Dr. Fuentes is unaware of and  as they tell their sordid stories, amidst flashbacks  and surreal dreams, a country whose people live in brutal chaos is revealed . This is a powerful movie, one to be seen more than once in order to fully enjoy. Although the story evolves around Dr. Fuentes and his crew,  there are several encounters with a funny couple who are \"informed\" tourists with bad Spanish accents  and worse pronunciation.

What kind of legacy is it possible to leave?  The setting of this movie is an unnamed country in South America. The writer/director, John Sayles, did this on purpose.  This is to show that the kind of thing depicted in the movie could happen anywhere.  However, it was shot in Mexico, in Spanish, with English subtitles.\nThe movie starts Federico Luppi as Dr. Humberto Fuentes, a wealthy doctor who is approaching retirement and has never paid close attention to the realities of his country.  His greatest achievement, the \"legacy\" he is leaving, is his participation in an international health program in which he trained young doctors to work in the poorest of villages.\nI watched this movie with horror and then, finally, resignation, as Dr. Fuentes travels in the mountains and makes startling discoveries.  I made a few startling discoveries myself -- the abject poverty of the people, the disregard for human life, the acceptance by the people of this as a way of life.  He finds that the people have no food.  He finds that both the army and the guerillas are equally brutal.  The movie takes us all on a journey with Dr. Fuentes.  Along the way we meet a homeless child, a priest who lives with his own private demons, and a deserter from the army with a history of participating in the carnage.  The movie goes deeper and deeper into the despair and devastation.\nThis is not a comfortable video to watch as it brings the viewer not only into the realities of the political systems in South America, but to the basic question of individual responsibility.

Instead, he gets out and the pod flies empty while the commander-in-chief uses the skills that won him the Medal of Honor to outwit those holding his staff and family hostage.\n\nIt's best not to think too strongly about the feasibility of the plot or the action but simply sit back and enjoy the violence, action, and heroics.  There's plenty of violence of both the good and bad kind as most of the  Secret Service is picked off one by one, some of the staff get killed and a couple throw themselves in front of bullets meant for the President.  There's a bit of quibbling going on as the people back in Washington argue over who's now in charge, some wanting to shoot the plane out of the sky, others wanting to wait and see before acting.\n\nWith an allstar cast, from Harrison Ford, Glenn Close as the Vice Prfesident who shows a little more levelheadedness than some of the other staff members, Xander Berkeley, Gary Coleman, Paul Guilfoyle, and William H. Macy, this is a well-acted, well-plotted movie which will leave the audience breathless. Fox TV called it a \"wild ride,\" and it's that in more ways than one, especially the plane-to-plane rescue scene. The special effects are great.\n\nThis DVD is owned by the reviewer and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Air Force One (1997) is a relentlessly paced thriller that is still very pertinent to the dilemmas faced (or depending on one's point of view, not faced) by present American leadership in a hostile and ambivalent world.  Though the underlying scenario is a bit outdated (ala 1990s), the themes are still engaging.  Harrison Ford turns in a nuanced and very skilled performance.  He is backed by several other strong actors, including a rather young Glenn Close acting as Vice President.  Liesel Matthews is remarkable as a 12 year old \"first daughter\" and Wendy Crewson is believable as First Lady.\n\nPlotting of the movie isn't perfect.  There are a few loose ends, but I won't spoil viewers' experience by discussing them at length.  Suffice it to say, there are some rather implausible acts by peripheral characters.  But overall, the story holds up well.\n\nAs a footnote, I would also add that I cannot imagine any US Presidential candidate in the current group of right wing crazies, panderers and political hacks, taking the public stand that Harrison Ford does as the President in this story.  His \"Be Afraid\" speech and the reasons behind it (\"because it's the right thing to do\") are long overdue from the leadership of our country.", "label": "good review"}

Now it has been 25 years since \"Air Force One\" has been a 747.  In 2023 the new Aircraft that will serve as Air Force One will be a 747-8.  When the last 747 was delivered it was based on a 747-200 at the time it was delivered the 747-400 was being delivered. The 747-8 has the same type rating as the 747-400 they both have no flight engineer. The new Aircraft being used for Air Force One may be modified to have a flight engineers position, because it will undoubtedly have many more systems than a regular 747-8.  It will essentially have a type rating unto itself and its twin(s).  That is, no 747-8 rated pilot would be qualified to fly Air Force One.  Piloting Air Force One is a prestigious job, although it is boring. There are Air Force pilots that don't want the job. Many former Air Force pilots won't work for the Air Lines for the same reason.

The most important part of video is the audio. you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal. I always say, half of video is audio. For years I used to run a line directly out of the DJ's mixer to get my audio. The issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking. Often though, the signal is to hot, the music is crap, or the dj says something stupid. With just the DJ's voice I can edit the way I want and compress time.

My only issue with the Hosa Y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short, so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when I plugged it into our lead singer's microphone.  It would be great on a guitar mic or something that's close to the ground, or horizontally placed, but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "While I didn't purchase these microphones, they were already used by the church I currently pastor. On top of that I have also done work as a mobile DJ and have used various microphones, so I do know what I am talking about when I say that, even for the price, there are better options on the market.\n\nInitially, I started using my own Shure PG48 (not the SM58) in place of one of the R21's that had been used for vocals, switching it over instead to amplify an acoustic guitar. The R21 did well when it came to amplifying acoustic instruments, so I was able to find a use for them, while using my entry-level Shure for vocals and just regular speaking, which that handled a lot better.\n\nThen, when I purchased a portable Behringer sound system, their XM1800S microphone came with it, so I was introduced to that. The XM1800S also comes in a three pack that's about $5 less, but it gets compared to the Shure SM58, with some professionals preferring it to the standard Shure microphone. So, I ordered the three pack of XM1800S, and am keeping the Samson R21's strictly as instrument microphones.\n\nI want to end this review by saying I don't hate the Samson R21 mics. They just weren't cutting it on vocals, but they have done well when it comes to instruments. As anything, it really depends on what you're using it for, but if you take my advice, use the R21 for instruments, use the Behringer XM1800S for vocals and save yourself $5.

They are also ideal if you are hosting jams and open mic nights and want reasonably reliable microphones that don't cost a fortune - but get the job done.\n\nWhat I love is the price and value. You get three instruments that may not be SM58s, but they are not terribly far off. And if you run them through an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Alesis-Mic-Tube-Duo-Stereo-Tube-Microphone-Preamplifier/dp/B005NIVLX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Alesis Mic Tube Duo Stereo Tube Microphone Preamplifier</a>&nbsp;I think you would be hard pressed to tell the difference in a blindfold test.\n\nOther factors that led me to give five stars include a protective case that comes with mic holders, attention to small details like the anti-dent ring on the windscreen, and low handling noise. In other words, they are inexpensive, but not cheap.\n\nYou can also use these to mic amps. Placing these 6\" from speakers (or bass drums or toms) captures a lot of low end. Move them back a foot or so and you get a more natural sound with a nice balance of highs, mids and lows.\n\nFinally, if you are starting up as a band on a budget, these and the dual channel pre-amp may be all the microphones you need for some time. In fact, you may be satisfied and not want to upgrade as you get more successful. But if you do, these can be relegated to the role of spares and you will continue to get value from them that way.", "label": "good review"}

In that case, I simply had to remind the key speaker to repeat the question and then answer it.

I also did a brief test recording audio in separate rooms, with a closed door - and while my test was far from complete, the audio was still good.  I think some of the concerns are the claims that this can work from 300 feet.  I can't say that it does or doesn't.  The 9V batteries lasted a good 8 hours each.

{"words": "This is an excellent all around solid performer. When compared to a stock Shure 92E, this Audio Technica 92ECD stands head and shoulders above the stock Shure in terms of high frequency response-cymbals etc. I'm sure the narrower elliptical stylus helps. However, a Shure M92e with an upgraded stylus gives this AT a good run for the money. No, the AT's not as \"neutral\" sounding as the Shure, but, to my ear anyway is also quite balanced. This is a good basic upgrade cartridge. It's not an \"audiophile\" contender but reproduces music nicely, well beyond most basic cartridges. Good \"universal\" value especially in that it can be used as either a P mount or standard. Have a listen, you can't go wrong for the price.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This particular Audio Technica cartridge will suprisingly enough yield very crisp and clear audio quality. Bass response is tight but not overwhelming nor weak. The wonderful thing about this type of cartridge is that it's basically a plug and play set up (just have to tighten a screw to hold it in place with most P-mount systems). The elliptical stylus or tip is designed for better contact with the stereo groove walls in a record resulting in better frequency response and clarity. The user does not have to worry about how much stylus pressure,weight, or anti-skating to provide to get the most from this cartridge;that's the beauty of using this cartridge on a P-mount tonearm instead of as a standard one...This cartrdige will perform admirably when used for regular record listening conditions. This is not a DJ stylus to scratch with as you may damage the needle and the record (\"burn\"). Also, it is more suitable for playing any kind of music except classical or jazz where a high end audiophile cartridge/needle would be needed. Such a high end cartridge and needle would bring out extreme musical detail as well as the ambiance or \"air\" of the instruments. Also, that would allow for better stereo separation as well... This is only a better than average cartridge meaning that you will only get about maybe a little over a year's worth of use from it (if you played one or 2 records a day or every 2 days respectively). That is also the difference between a basic low priced cartridge/stylus versus an audiophile grade one (those can usually go for about 5 years---but you would be talking anywhere from hundreds to maybe thousands of dollars).", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Needed a replacement for one of our turntables. Looked for something decent that didn't cost too much. Was preparing to spend about 50.00 until I ran across this one. Hooked it up and gave it a whirl and was very, very surprised at how good it sounds. It is right there on top. Better than the Signet it replaces and even better than the Stanton 881S. The latter of which has aged some 40 years so that may not be a fair comparison. The Stanton was state of the art for it's day and still sounds decent but figured, I don't spin the vinyl a lot so a decent cartridge would be more than adequate. Audio Technica has always made decent products. Their Mics and other equipment is reliable as it gets. You won't spend a lot of money but you will get a good product. Now, this cartridge is a bargain but sounds as good as some of the top selling ones selling for many times  the price. That's a huge bonus. With Amazon's great return policy, I figured it was worth a try and if it sounded awful, I could return it. Won't need to do that. It's a great find. I would not hesitate to get it again.\n\nPros: Great sound, all the hardware for both mounts are included. Highs and lows are well defined but not overpowering. Just clean. Mids are crystal clear. That is what we used to dream about in the old days. I couldn't see spending the money on a better one when these do so well and they do not require a lot of tracking force. That, alone, is a real bonus.\n\nCons: None.\nBottom line: Great cartridge. Very reasonable price.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Below applies to the AT311EP; for some crazy reason Amazon bundles a dozen or more cartridges together which are in some cases nothing alike, yet the reviews all flow as if they were one.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nYou cannot beat the value of this cartridge.\n\nFor one, the cost of the stylus itself is a few hairs shy of the cost Amazon offers the whole enchilada for.  Second, the performance of AT's is second-to-none for the P-mount form-factor.  Those of us, myself included, with a turntable taking this format find ourselves with dwindling options.  When I decided to replace the cartridge I bought my used Denon DP-7F with, I was nervous as I liked the sound the ADC (no model anywhere!) was putting out.  I ordered an AT3482 initially, which it turns out is an entry model void of any depth and life.  Harsh and cold, I disappointingly put the original back (aware with an unknown number of hours on the clock it could be wearing my vinyl faster), and I got Amazon to kindly take the 3482 back and sell me a 311EP.\n\nImmediately apparent was the increased clarity, depth, spatial separation, and eventually came the greater warmth.  It was sufficient off the bat, but I found (and have read others have had the same experience) that some time in, it gets the groove (pun intended) and shows its true colors.  I can say this was the case for me, and as long as you keep it clean with a stylus cleaner you will have a very pleasant experience.\n\nI can also say that a friend's house with Magnepan speakers off a vintage Carver amp and a Technics turntable with a very similar model cartridge gave depth and spatialization out of this world for this price point on Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here.\n\nThe instructions when you open the packaging tell you (out of an abundance of caution I hope) to remove the stylus from the cartridge when installing, then reinsert.  This looks easy on paper, but I couldn't get it to separate, and I was applying more than sufficient force to my thinking.  I can see why, you could bump into the needle with one of your fingers while pushing into the tonearm and then game over, but you just hold it by the sides, slide it in, then screw it down, and less than a minute later all is well.  You can't really make adjustments on the P-mount system, so you will get it right and without delay.\n-------------------------------------------------------Below applies to the AT100E----------------------------------------\nJust installed a month ago in a 1979 Dual 1264.  The Pickering XV15 from some time ago had the vintage look, and after I'd restored the Dual I tried to keep that look intact, starting with a new stylus to replace the original D400.  Turned out the tunnel the stylus went into was worn, and the assembly itself would come loose with playing and that of course is dangerous and resulted in poor sound.  Another $90 in to a labor of love, and enter the AT100E, which looks good and sounds good.\n\nRight off the bat, one difference between it and the EV stylus I tried to replace the D400 with (and even the AT311EP's I love) was that out of the box the sound was natural.  The EV stylus had lots of surface noise for a few hours, then dramatically settled down (I also cleaned it once but that didn't seem to do much), the AT311EP's settle down nicely after about 5-10 hours.  I've got about 20 hours on the clock with this one and it hasn't changed, which is impressive to me; maybe this will change in months' time.\n\nI am running the tracking force (at the recommendation of the shop that restored the Dual) close to the upper limit of 1.8 (I'm at 1.75, while the manual states optimal is 1.4).  The anti-staking is just shy of 2, and every so often it seems the right channel has some distortion which may mean I need to make a skating adjustment, but I have no blank vinyl to test it on (yet).\n\nThe needle doesn't ride quite as low as the AT311EP, which appears dangerously close to the vinyl, but never touches, even with a warp.  I miss the dust cap on the old cartridge/stylus, but am glad to stick with AT.  Much of my vinyl isn't new, esoteric 180g limited edition purchases, more of the good and great shape used copies from the Bay Area and Sacramento (a haven for collectors), so getting into the diminishing return rare air of uber equipment is not my gig.\n\nThe bass could use some extra umph, but what is there is warm and not overwhelming.  Highs are very natural and never harsh.  Jazz such as Miles Davis' Kind of Blue and Maynard really show the brass instruments and percussion.  LOTS of stereo separation, impressive staging if you sit in the sweet spot of your speakers.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "No makers I know about are producing a turntable that has a P-Mount tone arm.  For legacy turntables that require a P-Mount/T4P cartridge along with a record collection in excellent condition your choices for something better than a \"starter\" cartridge in the $25 to $70 range continue to dwindle.  Many major cartridge makers have eliminated all but their lesser P-Mount cartridges while others like Ortofon stopped making any T4P (P-mount) cartridge at all.  The AT-311EP is possibly the best sounding P-Mount cartridge still widely available at a price that about anyone can afford.  This AT311EP is not the best T4P/P- Mount cartridge ever made or even the best one still available at any price but in the price range it performs way beyond the cost.  (If you have more money to spend the Grado Black T4P is $75 and the Gold Grado T4P is something over $200.  The AT311EP specs approach the Grado Black for way less money.)\n\nAudio-Technica actually recently listed this AT311EP as \"discontinued\" on their website, so I thought those in the supply chain were all there would be. The ATN3472SE replacement stylus is safe since the AT92ECD uses the same stylus and that cartridge was not discontinued.  Then came good news that for some unknown reason Audio-Technica changed their mind so the AT311EP webpage no longer carries the \"discontinued\" stamping as of 04/04/2015.  So the AT311EP has been snatched back from the jaws of death. Very unusual for a discontinued product to make a comeback, but I'm glad and it was a good save.\n\nThe AT311EP is better than even other AT cartridges that look cosmetically identical, such as the AT92ECD, which costs a few dollars less.  The others are cheaper but the extra few bucks for the AT311EP is a good investment. The first reason I say the AT311EP is better is the ATN3472SE stylus used on both the AT311EP and AT92ECD is elliptical (also known as bi-radial) and is not conical (also known as spherical.)  This particular stylus is very narrow so it goes deeper into the groove than other elliptical styli in the cartridge's price range. The difference seems to matter less sound wise with a 45, but with a 33 microgroove album in excellent condition the difference in higher frequencies is obvious.  The AT92ECD cartridge has nearly identical specs to the AT311EP in all regards except for a 30% lower output voltage of 3.5 mv instead of the robust 5.0 mv output on this AT311EP.  The higher output of the AT311EP translates to a stronger signal for an improved signal to noise ratio.  To me the significantly higher output voltage from the AT311EP is more than worth the few dollars difference.\n\nAs an alternative choice the Shure M92E is another widely available and popular P-Mount elliptical option and a fair value too.  Shure now calls the M92E stylus \"bi-radial\" yet suffix that model with an \"E\" which has almost always has meant there is an elliptical stylus in a Shure phono cartridge.\n\nThe second reason I say the AT311EP is maybe the best affordable P-Mount cartridge left is the overall specs compared to others in the price class.  In output voltage it equals the Shure M92E but surpasses it in almost every other category and it should since the Audio-Technica is slightly more expensive.  Of course specs can be manipulated to say whatever the manufacturer wants by leaving out things like + or - dB or the specific frequency of a measurement tone.  However in the case of the AT311EP the incredibly wide range of reproduction specified at 15-27,000 Hz clues you into it being a very bright cartridge that also has a big low end.  AT does not spec a dB plus or minus tolerance in their frequency response spec, but the AT311EP has a brighter and more airy character than the Shure M92E while being equally robust in output and it exceeds the Shure in channel separation and channel balance specs.  The airy tone in the AT311EP cartridge works great with clean records in excellent shape but it can get annoyingly noisy on worn bargain bin records.\n\nShould you ever choose the Shure M92E over the AT311EP?  Yes.  When you have records in only fair to good shape and they are not perfectly clean the Shure M92E would be a more prudent choice since it tames at least some of surface noise present in worn or dirty discs.  So when should you choose the AT311EP?  When you have clean records in excellent shape and a system capable of doing something with the extra high frequencies it can pass.  The Shure by virtue of it's less pronounced high frequency voicing will sound better with less apparent surface noise when playing noisy records. The Shure is also going to collect a bit less dust from deep in the grooves since it doesn't go as deep where the real trash collects.  I've noticed the slightly narrower stylus on the AT311EP tends to collect way more stuff from old neglected records because it goes deeper in grooves where dust is next to impossible to remove with traditional record cleaning pads and carbon fiber brushes.  I can't get to some of that dust and gunk on used records from a second-hand store by using a Discwasher pad cleaner but the AT311EP stylus sure can.  When you have an excellent to near mint clean groove you can turn the treble up and the AT will sound far more airy without surface noise or distortion.\n\nI think the low distortion on the highs is a real strong point of the AT311EP.  It isn't brittle, it is clean.  I put on a really good copy of a very good recording (\"What's New\" by Linda Ronstadt with Nelson Riddle) and heard detail I frankly had never heard before with the Shure M92E.  On the other hand I put on a used bargain bin copy of an old Dells LP and even though I cleaned it best I could with the Discwasher and a carbon fiber brush the AT stylus collected so much stuff from deep in the groove I had to stop playing each side to clean off the dust clogged stylus and then resume play numerous times.\n\nBoth the AT311EP and Shure M92E are very light tracking cartridges with an optimum of 1 to 1.25 grams.  Neither should ever be used at more than 1.5 grams. The 1kH 29dB channel separation specs on the AT311EP are far better than the 1kH 20dB spec on the Shure M92E and darn close to the Grado Black's 30dB.  The channel balance specs on the AT311EP are slightly better than the M92E also, by 0.75 dB. The AT311EP uses a .1 mil narrower stylus so it goes a wee bit deeper into the groove than the Shure M92E which accounts for both some of the added brightness and turning it into a better dust collector on old neglected records.  The Shure has the advantage of a lower cost stylus replacement because the ATN3472SE stylus used in the AT311EP is harder to make since it is slightly narrower and because the AT's are imported from Japan.  Both the Shure and AT styli are diamond, thus about equally durable but the AT replacement is going to cost you more and stylus replacement cost matters to some people.  If you play a LOT of records or just like changing your stylus every few hundred hours then the Shure might be a money saver in the long run, but if you have a system capable of true fidelity the Shure simply is not as airy on the high end of the audio spectrum.\n\nIn an affordable P-Mount cartridge the AT311EP and the Shure M92E are the ones to consider right now for under $50.  Of the two the AT311EP sounds much better to me.  So P-Mount choices have narrowed dramatically in the past few years with most of the better P-Mount cartridges already gone and this midline AT311EP apparently barely escaping death. I love my old linear tracking turntable that uses P-Mount cartridges and this AT cartridge makes it sound way better to me. While it isn't the best in the world it beats the Shure in the high frequencies and for under $75 the AT311EP is the best P-Mount left that I know about.  I am perfectly happy with it when playing clean records in good shape but not as happy with older worn records.  This AT cartridge is not very forgiving at all.  Wear and scratches are going to be very apparent.  If it has a fault, it is clarity.\n\nIf you have a good stereo with a decent P-Mount turntable that tracks at 1.5 grams down to 1.0 gram with a record collection in above average shape this AT is possibly the best and brightest P-Mount elliptical cartridge left at under $70 for you.  If you have a system that doesn't pass much over 15k Hertz or records in less than ideal shape the Shure would be fine because you probably would not hear anything over 18k Hertz from your system anyway.\n\nEven though this AT311EP, the Shure M92E plus other AT cartridges are touted as \"Universal Mount\" and come with components included to adapt them to a traditional half-inch headshell mount, I would never suggest any P-Mount (T4P) cartridge for anything but a P-Mount tonearm.  There are better half-inch cartridges available for around the same money or just a bit more that are easier to setup on a half-inch mount headshell. The adapter components included with the \"universal\" cartridges add weight that frequently is hard to compensate for to get the tracking down to the 1.5 gram maximum and also add height that can cause setup complications such as an off tracking angle requiring shimming of the front mounting of the cartridge plus there can be azimuth angle compensation issues.  Mounting a half-inch cartridge is hard enough, don't make it harder by using a \"universal\" mount cartridge.\n\nThe lone surviving Shure P-Mount cartridge is a fair cartridge and I've used it before, but it is not as airy as the AT311EP.  I gave the AT311EP 5 stars because while there were better P-Mount cartridges available at a sane price there now are not any better ones.  So a 4 star cartridge by default becomes 5 star in absence of the better models that are gone. The next step up is the Grado Black and for the casual non-audiophile listener like me with consumer grade components, while very nice, a Grado would be overkill.  The AT311EP is a steal right now costing less than dinner and a movie.  Unless you spend $75 you just can't do any better in a P-Mount than this.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Recently installed a pristine Pickering XV-15/625e I bought years ago but never got around to using.  Put it in a Marantz 6300, installed it in the bedroom, and got some great new records.  At first I was a little disappointed with the sound.  It was a bit thin.  I thought that the Pickering might have aged out and perhaps the internals had dried up, hardened or softened just sitting in the case for all those years. Tried several receivers with good phono preamps but the results varied little.  Dug out some vintage external preamps but was still not delighted.  I finally got the Shure SFG-2 Tracking Force Gauge.  That was the missing link in my meticulous setup.  I've had some fine cartridges over the years, but few had the little brush attachment. Never felt the need for a brush.  I take good care of my records.  They are clean and static free.  But despite my best efforts, I quickly learned how notoriously inaccurate the calibration of even a good tonearm can be if you don't have a proper way to measure the tracking force.  Turned out the extra gram I thought I had added per the manufacturers spec to compensate for the brush was not even close.  So I used the guage, got a good reference for the stylus, added the extra gram, checked again and now I'm blasting Miles Davis Jack Johnson.  It's full, bright, has a nice throbbing bottom end.  No skips, no rumble.  A world of difference and I owe it all to getting the tracking dialed in with the help of this sweet little gauge.  Talk about money well spent!  Now I'll be setting up my Technics SL-1200 MK2 with a Stanton 681EEE downstairs in my studio.  I use that table more and I think it is pretty well balanced, but soon I will know for certain.

{"words": "UPDATE: I just ordered one of these for my niece as a March 11th birthday gift! Now that I have started using this, I don't need to wait any longer to tell you how wonderful it is. The best feature is that this has you look forward in setting goals, then review backward to see where you stand. I am the world's top procrastinator and scatter-brain. Using this the last few days is training me how to manage time and goals. It's very motivating to look at the big picture (6 months ahead), then narrow your focus to a weekly and more specific daily agenda. I wish I had had this when I was working a hectic job. The whole general-to-specific works perfectly with the look-forward/review-backwards concept, This really is brilliant.\n\nI've fallen into the habit of using phone apps for just about everything, but they are great for someone like me who can be kind of unorganized and manic about projects. I needed something I can hold and refer to more easily. This is better than any other planner/organizer I have used. Keep in mind that because this is not your usual planner, you have to take a little bit of time to get familiar with it. There is online info for using it and it's well worth every minute to check it out. I have never liked a planner this much so I'll try to just list the standouts.\n\nBest things about this:\n1. High-quality materials. The paper is great to write on with pen or pencil (I always use pencil) without bleed-through. The hardback cover feels amazing; it's a creamy, smooth texture that feels good in the hand & is easy to grip. The binder is made so that you can spread the planner flat without breaking the outer binding. That's genius, especially for those of us who will be using this to the fullest. (Don't overlook the pocket at the back of the planner, btw.)\n2. I can see how it will help me not only stay organized but also focuses on some current goals and projects. I don't always procrastinate out of bad habit; sometimes I just get overwhelmed with a project because I can't organize it easily. This should be perfect for that. (I'm working on a book and will be primarily using this or that and for health tracking.\n3. This planner does not just assume your occupation. You can use this one for your duties whether you are a parent, student, worker-from-home or, like me, a creative person. Every other planner I've used focused on one primary area of my life - usually work. I needed something like this that takes into account that I have LOTS to track and need help focusing.\n\nMy favorite sections are the ones to plan and review. I also like the Daily Priorities and Notes & Ideas. I love that this fits in smaller spaces like my purse or backpack. It's possible to just hand-carry this without it being in the way.\n\nLike I said, this is not a planner you can just pick up and start using; you have to check the instructions first. Because of the way this planner is set up, I'm going to be getting one for my niece (who is a mom and a realtor).\n\nOnce I've used this for a month or so, I will try to come back and update with any more observations.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I love the set up of the notebook and the whole aesthetic , I only wish there were more notes pages and that the paper were thicker, almost all my pens fully ghost through the pages.\n\nAlso notes for creatives who like to decorate/glam up their planner, this planner is pretty small and crammed by the layout, so would not recommend if you want to use Washi tape/sticky notes/etc. this is for the minimalists.", "label": "good review"}

As much as I love bullet journals and DIY, unfortunately I do not have the time to create my own planner. Finally, I found an agenda/planner that works! The size is not too large so I can carry it around with me to school or work. There is a monthly, weekly, and daily section. In the back there are extra sheets for notes/mind maps. There is of course the standard pocket to hold loose paper in the back but also in the front! The paper is also good quality however I do not think I can use my fountain pen. So far I have only used pencil and muji 0.5 gel pens. Works great and I will definitely buy again.", "label": "good review"}

When trying to get this hung up, I quickly realized that it's a pain. I suggest you lay out your piece and cut it. Then you can hang it up.

I taped the sides back together but it made me wonder about durability despite my experience when I first put it up\n\nOverall, I am still happy with it.

These are printed on heavy card stock and are durable - as long as they are not mis-used. They are brightly colored foil on the edges and have rainbow colors.

There is no sparkle on these stars, No glitter, no reflection except on the gold portion of the stars. The stars I received had different colors on the stars than pictured here. The mid sized stars were \"rainbow\" the larger ones were a darker blue. The back is completely white, so you could have a project where the students fill in the back of the star themselves.\n\nReally, there is nothing particularly great about these stars.

That, and the fact that the pages are slick rather than absorbent (I like to use rollerball pens versus ball point) is the only reason I rated it less than five stars. There is room for the name, address, various phone and fax numbers and email addresses on each entry. I am very happy with this phone book, in spite of the fact that I'm going to have to use a different pen than I like to add names to it.", "label": "good review"}

The first one I bought lasted a little over a year until I dropped it and the binding in the back tore. The second one I purchased lasted for for over a year until I filled out every page. I particularly like the graph paper versions. My job requires the occasional construction sketch. If you like keeping a dedicated work notebook then these are an excellent choice. If the price was a little cheaper I would have no problem giving them a 5 out of 5.\n\nUpdate: I have tried the Moleskin equivalent, which is nice, but I still prefer the Piccadilly version. The Moleskin have much darker grid lines and the binding is not as flat as the Picadilly ones. Next I will try Google's version, but for now the Piccadilly are my favorite.", "label": "good review"}

I like that the squares go all of the way to the edge of the pages and are consistent throughout the book. The binding is well done and the pocket holds up well.

From time to time they seem to misalign themselves (even just opening and closing them without anything between), which causes the blade to catch on the guard and malfunction.

{"words": "These are absolute rubbish. I long since replaced them with another brand, but when I saw these on Amazon I had to share my experience. First and foremost, I am a Fiskars fan, and have been for a while. I adore their genuine Finnish made products, especially their famous orange handled scissors for crafts/sewing/indoor stuff (which, once upon a time, were made in Finland with steel brought in from Sweden), but also their garden related products. Unfortunately, many years back, Fiskars became a global importer and ceased all manufacturing in Finland. Typically you can only find old stock from the made-in-Finland days, otherwise it's just new, made-in-China junk.\n\nThese bypass pruning shears, a newer product offering that was only ever made in China, is a case in point. Their quality is pitiful, especially given the relatively high price point compared to other China junk. The blade is garbage and cuts like you'd expect from poorly made-in-China pruners, i.e. not very well if at all. They jam up constantly, even on light duty jobs, because they are neither polished nor coated to prevent plant material from sticking to them and gumming up the hinge. Furthermore, the button mechanism to lock/unlock also constantly locks itself in the middle of being used, resulting in complete work stoppage to unlock it again. If you're wearing gloves appropriate to doing most yard work, this can be a real pain, because you need to remove them to wrestle with this stupid thing over and over when it locks itself for the umpteenth time.\n\nIt pains me as a Fiskars brand enthusiast to give a 1-star rating, but honestly, these are probably some of the worst pruners I have ever used. They're not sharp, they're not well made, they're not well engineered, they're not durable, the locking mechanism is poorly designed and executed, the ergonomics are nonexistent and the tool simply does not work for its intended purpose. This incredibly typical of made-in-China garbage riding on what used to be a high quality brand name. It's a shame that Fiskars sold out. I would not recommend this product at all, and certainly not at this price point. You're paying for a name that no longer has any connection the level of quality in the product. It's just import junk like everything else now.", "label": "bad review"}

The safety lock fell apart and fell off by year #2 [I use a rubber band or twist tie to keep them closed in storage].  Personally, I feel that was very poorly constructed to fall apart, but also it didn't always stay locked.  So, if that's a big issue for you, don't get these pruners.  Definitely would be concerned in a household where kids could get a hold of these.\n2.  Stainless steel issue....  These will rust if left wet.  The operative word here is \"left\".  I wash mine after every use and them proceed to dry it carefully.  If left wet, these pruners WILL rust.  But if you dry them off, they don't rust.\n3.  Teflon coating...  While a nice idea, someone forgot that pruners/shearers/etc. do need to be sharpened.  During the sharpening process, well, there goes your teflon coating.  Don't look at that as a big selling point as it won't matter down the line.\n4.  Oil... Simply, put, this pruning tool needs it from time to time.  A few reasons:  keeps the blade from rusting if/when stored wet, keeps rust from forming around bolts/screws, keeps it operating more smoothly & easily.  I give it a good coating of WD40 before storing it for the season and spray it every now and again during the use seasons.", "label": "bad review"}

I'd never heard of the brand, but the clerk assured me that Fiskars made good garden tools. (I might add that Fiskars was about the only brand the shop sold.) Well, I purchased the Fiskars pruning shears and a Fiskars lopper and I've been very satisfied with these particular garden tools, much more so than other brands I've owned.\n\nThe Fiskars Pruning Shears are somewhat crude in appearance but they're ruggedly built and maintain a sharp cutting edge. I've put these shears to a lot of use and they've yet to be sharpened. Plus, the blades seem to be absolutely stiff and don't bend under forceful use. I can cut green limbs up to about 3/4\" with these.  I'd say this is the best pruning shears I can remember using, certainly much better than the last two brands. I can't help notice \"Made in U S A\" stamped on one side of the tool. I hope this is still true.\n\nGary Peterson", "label": "good review"}

The brass fittings are designed to not restrict the water flow into the hose, thus permitting maximum water flow. The nozzle features compliment those of the hose.

Heres a photo after 7 years of heavy use & abuse.\n\nOriginal review:\nAfter using this hose I will never go back to small diameter garden hoses.  The water flows with much more force, which is especially useful when using the jet nozzle.  Most garden hoses are only 1/2\" diameter, and some premium hoses are 5/8\", but this is 3/4\".\n\nThere is a significant water pressure loss with regular hoses because the smaller diameter means that more of the water is in contact with the walls, plus it flows at higher velocity further increasing the friction.  You'd be amazed looking at the charts, just how much pressure is lost with the cheap standard hoses.  For example:\n\nI'm looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart.  At 5 gallons per minute, the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4\" pipe (same size as this hose).  For a 1/2\" (regular hose size) pipe the head loss is 20.7 ft - that's 4x less height that the water can travel merely because of friction from the smaller inside diameter.", "label": "good review"}

As a child I loved Lamb Chops and I thought my pup would like her too. Since opening Lamb Chops, he sleeps on top of her, walks around with her, and genuinely likes her (maybe a little too much, since hes been found in questionable situations with her). Hes not the type of dog to become clingy with any toy, he could really care less about any toy he has, but I think I found the one.

The face with the bushy eyebrows may be cute for a childs toy but for a dog, it is an invitation to chew.  Eventually, that chewing leads to a major hole in the face :(\n\nI decided that since they love Lambchop so much, I would try to give it a face transplant.  I sewed a piece of chamois cloth over the face and used permanent markers for the facial features.

{"words": "My 4yr old border collie male just LOVES his lamb chop, I'd give dog like ability of you a 5* rating.  Samson has dozens of toys and he likes to pic a toy for the day.  Lamb chop is that toy 50% of that time, until, I had to take it away to the hospital for surgery(meaning, I have to sew it up).  I gave Samson this for 2015 Christmas and he loved his lamb chop instantaneously.  The reason for the 2 star rating?  It's for the type of material used for lamb chops face and front feet.  It's made out of a knit, sock like material that tore very easily.  Samson does t tear up his toys anymore.  Though he does play rough with them.  He had lambchop less than 2 weeks when I noticed the first holes in the knit material on one foot, soon holes in the knit material on its face followed, soon after that, the other foot developed holes.  In less than a month the holes in his face knit material had multiplied to point stuffing fell out. That's when I took lambchop away.  Oh, after first hole in lambchops face, Samson found where the insidesqueaker was and was working towards it, so I reached in and removed squeakers.  I'm sad that they used such a stupid material for its face and front legs.  Usually when a seam copes undone, (which is usuall the case when his babies need to go to hospital), I just get out some upholstery thread and a needle and sew it shut.  The way this knit material is, I'm at a loss as how to repair his toy.  This toy would make an awesome baby toy minus the squeaker but a lousy puppy toy or any dog that has teeth and actually plays with his toys.  Obviously whoever designed toy with this knit  material hasn't a clue about how dogs play with their toys.  I wouldn't recommend this toy to any dog owner due to the knit material tears so easily, even with normal play. I found another lamb toy that Samson just loves, it's one of kong' s lambs.  After a couple of months, the face seam did come apart but was easily repairable.  This toy is too difficult to figure how to repair.  Usually when I repair a toy, it does t come apart again where I repair it.  This toy though, I know that knit material will keep tearing.  Funny thing is, Samson has blunted teeth, they aren't sharp, so it makes me wonder what would happen with this toy with a dog with sharp teeth....", "label": "bad review"}

The chocolate tastes good. You should know that they are a little dry. They aren't crunchy dry, and it's not a negative comment either, it's just a good idea to have your favorite beverage nearby to wash them down with!

Because Kashi products are low in fat and have few ingredients that bind the others together, they do not remain intact during shipping.\n\nI ended up using the crumbled Kashi Cookies Oatmeal Raisin Flax as cereal.

They are a good sized soft cookie and you can break them off in smaller bits and not have them crumble.  Just sweet enough, but not so sugar sweet as many store-bought cookies.  You can also definitely feel the chew of the oatmeal and the chocolate doesn't have that cheap taste.  I honestly enjoyed them, enough that I had trouble just stopping with one.\n\nYes, these cookies are soft, but if you want them to stay that way you have to seal them back up again if possible once you open the package.

They are only 130 calories per cookie and have 12 whole grains or 14% of your fiber.  They are low in sugar with only 8 g.  Also low in salt at 3% of your daily amount, no transfat or cholesterol. Naturally Sweetened: rolled oats and wildflower honey for a touch of natural sweetness.\n\nAs far as taste, they are grainy with oats and the bursts of dark chocolate flavor.

I like the soft texture, although there is some grittiness due to the oatmeal and fiber. Not objectionable, however.

{"words": "As an IT for a large corporation, I spend a lot of time testing out different vendor's products.  This 19dbi panel antenna is by far the most powerful wifi antenna I have ever used.  I installed the first one at a marina, expecting to need at least three additional repeaters.  After connecting the antenna at the beginning of the docks I was able to get signal all the way to the end of the docks, (about 1 mile), with houseboats completely obscuring any line of sight.  I had five bars almost the entire way to the end of the dock.  When I reached the furthest point from the antenna, I had one bar of signal.  I kept a persistent ping going the entire time, and I did not get a single timeout, even when reduced to one bar.  I tested my Iphone as well and received similar results.  I have now purchased quite a few more of these antennas.  These are definitely a goldmine for the wifi world.  It is a relief to finally find an antenna that lives up to its expectations so that I don't have end users always complaining to me about poor signal strength.  I will be installing these at several lodging establishments and rv parks over the next few months, so I will post again with the results of those scenarios.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Great 8-port switch.  I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.  They need lead in the bottom to hold them in place.  Alrighty then.", "label": "good review"}

Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.

I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.

{"words": "Power and layout are the two big advantages to this USB hub.  This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says \"T7Hub\" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for \"permanent\" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.  The following hardware comes inside the box: the hub, its power supply, and a USB 2.0 cable.", "label": "good review"}

It does everything I expect higher end web-managed switches to do, and is extremely affordable. I like that 3Com has redesigned this line to have flat case tops instead of the rounded tops they used to have (no more need for the extra bracket in order to put something on top of it). Make sure that you upgrade the firmware on this switch right out of the box before doing ANYTHING else; there's a bug in the shipped firmware that will brick the switch when you set the password and you'll have to console into it to recover otherwise.

{"words": "I am a computer geek. I have a lot of devices, many of those with ethernet ports. For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.\n\nThat device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).\n\nI wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.\n\nA bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.\n\nSetup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).\n\nAnother bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.\n\nThe downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive \"ethernet to Wi-Fi\" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.\n\nThe PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang \"g\") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps \"turbo\" mode in 802.11a! (haven't tested it).", "label": "good review"}

I had a horrible time installing it and it never really worked right.  When I purchased a Western Digital USB 2.0 External Hard Drive to add to my system is when I found out not all usb cards are created the same. The WD hard drive just would not operate on the cheaper usb 2.0 card. I could not transfer files or write to the drive without getting errors.  I thought it was the hard drive but after exchanging it and getting another one only to have the same problem I determined it must be the usb controller.\nThat is when I searched the net and looked at reviews for the best USB 2.0 card out right now.  Every computer magazine website gave this card excellent reviews so I thought I would buy it from Amazon.com and give it a try.\nIt was very easy to install and I absolutely love the added front USB port which is included in the box and fits in an open 5 1/4 bay.  Since I have an older machine I did not have any front usb ports. With this in mind along with the great reviews it has been given the purchase was a no brainer.

If you must know just one important thing about USB 2.0, remember not to unplug the peripheral device when the PC is on.

A big plus this year is the automatic import of W2 files. If you have one of the larger firms handling your company's payroll, this option is a great timesaver. It even calculates your Tax stimuluss rebate! The carryover of federal info to state is also a big plus.\nThe biggest Con is the EFile fee, $17.95 for both federal and state separately. This is a rip off. Efiling your federal return will speed your tax stimulus rebate (if you qualify), but it is not worth it for both. There is an option when you have completed your taxes to give your feedback in a survey and to join the TurboTax Inner Circle. I strongly suggest you do so the let Intuit know what you think of their extra charges.\nIntuit makes what I think is the best tax filing software.

{"words": "I am a long time TurboTax user, and Premier this year shows progress from previous years in most areas. Importing W-2 and some investment data is a breeze, although several mutual fund entries had to be made manually. I found that switching between the interview and forms was less than optimum this year: the forms menu was touchy and hard to navigate accurately, and annoyingly, was not complete.\n\nOne huge oversight is that form 1040-V, which anyone who owes tax needs (although you can technically file without it), is apparently missing in action. It did not print with my return, and when I went to forms it is not even in the list, making a trip to the IRS web site necessary to manually find, print, and fill out the form. Strangely, the corresponding form for my state taxes did print with my return and was accurate. TurboTax also had an issue with my state taxes when it wouldn't accept an entry I made (correctly) from a 1099-R. It insisted a certain number (a state tax ID number) had to be seven digits long, yet the number (which the payer, Fidelity Investments, confirmed) was nine digits long on the 1099-R. TurboTax would not allow me to overwrite the field, and I had to write a cover letter to file along with my state taxes (which necessitated paper filing). The program also lacks a decent search function. I had a complex issue involving a payment taken as stock which I had to research completely on my own (the J. K. Lasser book is still a great tool to have on hand). I also find that for both the 2006 and 2007 tax years TurboTax is inflexible about keeping your files in anything but PDF format, which I consider to be a major inconvenience.\n\nOverall I still find TurboTax the best self-preparation tool on the market, but it is not without its frustrations. I recommend the program, but caution that if you have complex returns, TurboTax is not a perfect tool and has some subtle flaws that pester the user.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "This game is a combination hidden-object/brain and offers up an engaging story and gorgeous scenery to move it all along.  The game's storyline involves a woman searching for her daughter who has been captured by an evil fairy.  The characters find themselves trapped in dreams, involved with fairies- imagination runs high in this game, and those who enjoy fairy and dream-related themes will likely enjoy this.  To play the game you look through each scene for items you can pick up that allow you to further progress through the scene.  For example, if you encounter a door with a lock, you might have to find the pieces to assemble the lock.  The items to solve the puzzles can be hidden anywhere- one might be down a well, for example, so to get to it you might have to find the rope, crank, and bucket.  Crank rusty?  Then you might need to find some oil.  Your cursor indicates when you're on top of something that needs attention, and you can use the clues from these to help you know exactly what you need to find.  The game doesn't tell you what to do, and a big part of the challenge is figuring it out for yourself.  This game is not a long as most other hidden object games, but it's a great deal of fun, and I bought the sequel as soon as it came out.", "label": "good review"}

I experienced exactly what some of my artistic friends were talking about in 2002--Painter is absolutely amazing.  It felt a little weird to use with the Wacom pen at first, but it wasn't long before I wondered how I ever got along without them.  From 2007 onward, Painter has proven to be indispensable as well as a joy to use.  It's the real reason I purchased a computer and I enjoy it as much now as the first time I used it.  I use it as a complement to Photoshop & Paint Shop Pro as well as creating artwork from a scanned drawing or sketch.  Besides the different brushes and media available in Painter, I also enjoy the fact that Painter automatically creates a duplicate of whatever you're working on after you \"Save As\" as well as turning photographs into artwork.  I don't get into the \"Painter versus Photoshop\" argument because it's a non-issue.  Both are great at what they do and are a joy to use together.  Most of all, Painter 4 was very reasonably priced and I had no problems with it whatsoever.  A clean interface that's easy to understand and use plus the fact that Painter pays for itself.\n\nAs I said in my Paint Shop Pro review, the one thing I would wish for in future iterations would be a natural drawing interface similar to Autodesk Sketchbook or MyPaint (an open-source drawing program).

{"words": "I'm a cheapskate when it comes to PC applications, so I've spent much of my artistic career on bundled programs. I still draw and edit in Microsoft's generic \"Paint\" program. And when I bought a camera that included a \"Limited Edition\" of Adobe Photoshop 5.0, I loaded it up eagerly--only to find the interface clunky and disorienting. I don't manipulate my digital pictures very much, because they tend to have satisfactory hue, saturation, and values from the outset, and I'm not into gimmicks like stain-glass filters.\n\nI needed something oriented more towards free-drawing, but with more intuitive photo styling for those rare occasions. So naturally I checked out Corel's latest  budget art program, Painter Essentials 4.\n\nRight off the bat, PE4 is light years ahead of Vista's Paint program, and noticeably superior to my old Adobe program. Granted, it lacks some photo-specific options, like red-eye reduction and other assorted filters. The layer system is also a bit more primitive. But it can do everything else and then some. PE4 is more stable and intuitive than PS 5.0 LE, with big friendly icons and tool tips.\n\nPE4 is chiefly an editor. For example, graphic novelists or cartoonists can use it to digitally fill color. However, the toolset supports scratch artwork. To that end, it alternates between two tabulated interfaces: \"Photo Painting\" and \"Drawing & Painting\", which can be selected at will from the canvas. All tools are available for either mode.\n\nThese include a text box for labeling pics, and a number of shader wizards and style presets to transform photos into paintings or line drawings. Of note is the auto-painter, which accepts a number of presets for Edge, Color, Paper, and Brush types. It does require practice and discretion to make anything look good, as it is easy to overwhelm a picture with garbage. And yes,  artists can manually touch-up or alter images without any reliance on auto-painting. Finally, the user can load and save a variety of file formats beyond the default Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), including TIFF, JPEG, bitmaps, Macintosh PICT, and Photoshop PSD. The program also seems to automatically generate backup files in RIFF.\n\nThe biggest leg over my old Photoshop, however, are the brushes. PE4 includes 95 different brushes, tips, and blenders called Art Tips, loaded into a tab labeled the Brush Box. Art Tips divide into eight catagories:\n\nThick Paint\nThin paint\nWatercolor\nPencils & Pens\nDry Media\nBlenders\nEffects\nPhoto\n\nThese implements are all presets; users cannot customize their own brush shape or paint consistency. However, they may vary the brush-size from a pin-point to a dinner plate, adjust the opacity, and alternate between free-hand and straight line strokes.\n\nI don't own a stylus and pad, so I can't review that section, but I can testify to mouse-based art. Right-clicking the cursor brings up a context-sensitive menu, though the options are limited to different brush types within the category, plus incremental size changing. The brushes are self-explanatory and they work the canvas as I expect. Strokes have built-in anti-aliasing and a decent resolution; they still look ragged and a touch pixilated on my high-def LCD monitor, but better than my old programs. Out of the box, the cursor doesn't draw as smoothly as I would like, so users will need to make some adjustments. Images print with soft edges and clear resolution.\n\nThe big downside for me has been memory leaks and CPU hogging. Particularly when trying to paste material from another program, PE4 is as slow as a dial-up connection. It shouldn't take five minutes to import a track list or Christmas message from my Word program. And I should not see my CPU running up to 80 or 90%. Simply booting the program is slow compared to my other applications, and I can't see the justification for this.\n\nAlso, PE4 should not be seen as a substitute for a document design program. There are no geometry shapes or tables or chart wizards. Just strokes, lines, and your imported images.\n\nOn the whole, the program is pretty-looking and diverse enough for my bohemian tasks. It ought to serve any low-budget artist, especially students and hobbyists. However, Painter Essentials 4 does require a patch to deal with these slowdowns and memory leaks, which can drag out the simplest project. Also, the list price of $99 is too high--the Amazon.com figure of 45-55 bones is acceptable.", "label": "good review"}

So I personally was not put off by the fact that things like spell check will not work if you use Outlook 2007 with the rest of the Office 2003 suite. That's been well documented here by other reviewers, so I won't go into it.\n\nPutting those issues aside, this is a really nice upgrade. A lot of upgrades are sort of \"so what\", but this one really impressed me. First, the look and feel of it is much more polished. It's more than just a pretty face, I find the items on my calendar for instance much more striking and easier to see what I have coming up at a glance. While the install itself seemed endless, the final product does seem to run plenty fast enough on my machine (it's fairly high end, 8 GHz, 3 gig of RAM) older machines may have more problems. Outlook 2007 uses a different style of toolbar than older versions, I really like the new toolbar, with the tabbed panels and fancier icons, it's just a matter of getting used to it. Here are some highlights from the different sections of Outlook, things that I specifically like or don't like. Please note that in some cases, I may be mentioning things that are possible to do with customization...however, they are not things that are easy for the average user to figure out, particularly since the product comes with basically no documentation at all, other than typical Microsoft Help.\n\n1. Email - as mentioned, I don't really use this much, but it *does* include a really nice RSS reader with a large list of feeds you can add immediately. Ironically, the one for Outlook 2007 is wrong, it adds the Outlook 2003 feed, I went to the Microsoft site to find the link for the correct one. One thing I also noticed is that when you are in Email, or any other area of Outlook other than the Calendar, there is a new \"To Do\" bar that displays all your upcoming appointments and tasks, and a field to create new tasks. Really great new feature.\n\n2. Calendar - I really like the way appointments look as mentioned. Also there are now very clear Day - Week - Month buttons at the top, these were not as easily found in the previous version. I do find it funny that there is still no Year view. I can do this with calendar apps on my tiny Pocket PC, it seems ridiculous that I can't see a yearly overview, or at least a 3 month overview on my desktop. Also, there doesn't seem to be a way to customize the number of lines for appointments on the monthly calendar. If you don't have large numbers of appointments, it'd be nice to show 2 lines so you can read the whole appointment, as you can on the weekly view. In particular, this would be nice when printing calendars, rather than holidays and birthdays that are all chopped off. I did notice that I have spell check available when creating appointments, so clearly it's available for at least some functions. I also though ran into issues with Outlook not wanting to save my appointment when I was editing it and trying different options...but it didn't give me any really detail as to why, just kind of a random thing.\n\n3. Contacts - In additional to the new interface, you've got all kinds of new stuff you can add and link with contacts. There's some neat new options, such as a link to go to the address on MSN maps, open their webpage in your browser, total customization of the business card for the contact, etc. You can add images to their contact notes, as well as a variety of other things like charts and graphs if you have the rest of Office 2007. I did notice as well that I can now sort my contacts by category. This drove me nuts in the 2003 version, that it would not sort by category, so very glad to have it now!\n\n4. Tasks - Fairly similar to the changes with contacts, lots of additional things you can link to the task, I like being able to paste in the business card of the contact for the task, for instance. You can also link the task over to an account in the Business Contact Manager\n\n5. Notes are still a bit more basic than I care for, but I use OneNote so only use these rarely now. It's definitely easier now to group them into categories, color code them, sort them, etc. but very basic functionality. OneNote is so superior in every way, but unfortunately is still sold as a separate product. Kind of a side note here...but I really wish that with many of these parts of Outlook you could add drawings as you can in OneNote, for those of us that have a tablet.\n\n6. Business Contact Manager - So here's the real jewel in this product. I really didn't use the one that came with Office 2003 and only now see how much I was missing! First, to use this it will install SQL Server Express on your machine. I run standard SQL Server from a separate box, so it would have been nice to be given the option to specify a SQL location to use instead of forcing a new install of the server on me. But at least it only starts up when you try to access this section of Outlook, so that reduces the load at least somewhat on your machine. Overall, I'm pretty impressed with how much this does, the name really doesn't do it justice. I'm really putting some time into getting my current accounts, contacts and projects loaded into this, as it basically does the same sort of things that I was using a different project management program to do. Now, this is hardly going to replace a full-fledged, multi-user project management software application. But for a sole proprietor like myself, it does the basics well enough to be useful. I can create projects, enter tasks for the project, add notes and hours worked, view custom reports on my projects, etc. I don't do much sales and marketing at the moment, but that's all in there as well. I really just wish it did even more. I'd like to be able to link files and documents to my tasks, for instance, or at least, include better integration with OneNote, which is ideal for project documents and notes. I found it particularly strange for instance, that in my regular Contacts, I had a link to OneNote to create custom notes for that contact...but I did not have the same button in the Business Contacts (which is where it is *really* needed.) Better integration with OneNote would really be a huge boon to those of us that are using both of these products.\n\nJust as an additional side note, I was glad to see the upgrade did not break my ActiveSync with my SmartPhone, everything still works fine and syncs properly. I did notice that the contacts in the Business Contact Manager do not sync with the PPC, but that's to be expected (just something to be aware of). There's also still a big problem with Outlook and that is the issue of alarms not going off if the program isn't up and running. I always like to have them synced to my phone so I am less likely to miss them just because the program isn't open.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent upgrade, as long as you have a machine that can handle it and are not effected or bothered by the various issues with using it along with the Office 2003 suite. Some improvements to some functions would make it even better, but it is certainly still worth a look.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Cosmetically, this version is not radically different from Outlook 2003 (which I upgraded from).  The big different is the inclusion of Business Contact Manager - which for my needs proved to be a more than adequate contact manager - with a great level of detail.\n\nSQL 2005 Express is installed in the background as the database engine for BCM.  Be advised that you will have to setup a maintenance schedule within SQL 2005 Express to dump the DB, etc.\n\nThe feature added to Outlook 2007 that I really like is the addition of RSS feeds.\n\nUnlike one other reviewer, I had no problem with my 'down-level' office products installed on my PC.  Office 2003 applications peacefully co-existed with Outlook 2007.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "A year or so ago, I switched to Outlook, and while I can't say that I really liked it, I did find that it was an improvement over my old email program in a couple of important ways.  It offered integrated address book, and calendar functions, and it didn't crash every fifteen minutes.  I got used to its drawbacks because it offered me greater functionality.\n\nAlong comes Outlook 2007 with the contact manager, and suddenly there's a whole new level of functionality to make me even happier.  Now I can sync my Outlook calendar with my Google calendar, import RSS feeds and, with a tiny app and a couple of keystrokes, I can import contact information quickly from any online resource.\n\nOn the downside, and predictably, it takes forever to install.  Backup of everything except archived mail is sort of a pain, and the way it creates files is kind of squirrely.  But in general I'd say that it's made keeping track of my life just a bit simpler.  And that's worth a lot to me.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "The installation went flawlessly. I opted not to install Business Contact Manager.\n\nThe Outlook itself is quite complex and useful for managing your workflow in a busy environment. If you need a tool to just manage your personal email, there are, probably, less heavy tools.\n\nIn 2007 edition Microsoft added a ribbon on the title bar of the message viewer. This ribbon is a customizable bar with buttons. One change that I didn't like comparing to 2003 edition is that in order to edit a saved message instead of simply selecting \"Edit\" in a drop-down menu, one has to either find \"Revise Contents\" or add it as a button to the ribbon. The whole indivudla message window interface is brought in line with all Microsoft Office 2007 look, but the Outlook's main window still looks like 2003 with some changes in the menus.\n\nI don't like the changes to the Search functions interface. Now to search a folder for a message with a keyword you have to navigate to Tools>Instant Search>Advanced Find -- right-clicking on a folder in the Mail Folders' pane won't is not possible any more since there is no option for searching in the Folder rclick pop-up menu.\n\nOne can go to Tools>Instant Search>Search Options and set \"All Folders\" in the \"Instant Search Pane\" area and hope that every time you start a search it would go through all folders. Nope! If you don't check \"Search Subfolders\" after pressing \"Browse...\" button in the Advanced Find, the search will NOT go into the subfolders. This means that either this feature doesn't work or the interface is confusing...\n\nI definitely don't like the hard-shell plastic packaging: it take a lot of space, hard to see where it's sealed, and opening it was a challenge.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I was new to Vista when I received my new laptop, so I wasn't aware of the changing software landscape that seems to be a hallmark of Microsoft products.  Although I did get the Microsoft Office Suite, it now excludes Outlook.  This made me very, very angry.\n\nWhen the opportunity to review this latest incarnation of Outlook came along, I jumped at it, because life post-Outlook is pretty awful. And, now that I'm back in the warm bosom of Microsoft's email program, I can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nThis is the same Outlook you either love or hate.  The programs still seem to be developed independently of each other. There's also junk email scanning which is semi-useful if you don't have spam blocking on your server side. The Reading Pane is omnipresent but removable and there's this irritating tendency to group messages into, well, groups, as if the entire world thought that would be a good idea for message sorting.  News flash: It isn't. Fortunately, it can be turned off.\n\nThe calendar is the same as other Outlook calendars, only a little more graphically appealing.  You still cannot easily import data from one of the Outlook programs to the other; dragging and dropping emails preserves body and header.  Similarly, you can drag an email to your contacts, but that only drops the email name into the contacts list and dumps the entire body into Notes field.  In other words, there's no smart way to navigate content between the various sub-programs within Outlook.  This is something that's sorely needed.  The electronic signature at the bottom of emails is becoming the de facto business card, and it'd be nice if we could just import that content right into Contacts.  But alas, Outlook's not about to be THAT innovative.\n\nThe other new thing that hangs around, waiting for you to notice it, is the To-Do Bar.  As if navigating the myriad of Outlook programs who don't really like each other wasn't difficult enough, you are now expected to navigate sideways.  From a space perspective, this makes sense; there's more real estate on the horizontal axis of most monitors.  But it is counterintuitive to the rest of the Outlook design, which is top to bottom. The To-Do Bar is basically what used to happen when you clicked on your name in older versions of Outlook: it summarizes all your relevant information in one place. The problem is that it won't go away easily. It eventually goes away if you can figure out how to ask it nicely.  But apparently each application is treated like its own entity, so removing the To-Do Bar from say, email, means it still shows up when you're in Tasks.\n\nFinally there's what's new in this version of Outlook, the Business Contact Manager.  It requires SQL server. This is most useful if you're running a business, and contains everything from projects to accounts, billable hours to marketing campaigns.  It's of particular use to freelancers and hourly consultants; as a consultant myself once, I ended up using the journal to clock my progress, but the BCM can do it better.  Being the new kid on the block, BCM is better integrated with all the other programs.\n\nAt times, Outlook's various programs seem like squabbling in-laws at a wedding...related and not happy about it.  If you can look past that - and if you're a seasoned Outlook user, chances are you're used to it - then this is definitely worth the investment.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I have never been especially fond of Outlook, but I was willing to give it another try with this version in the hopes that my previous complaints had been addressed. I can't say I am especially impressed with this version either, though there are some good things I can say about it regardless.\n\nI have been using Outlook in the workplace as a standard for years now. It integrates with MS Office (another standard in the office, though I use something different at home) and it generally gets the job done, though it is slow about it. I have found that Outlook 2007 is no exception in that regard - this is not a nimble application and it takes a lot of memory and resources to run well. If you have a lot of memory and space that's not really a concern, but it is something about which to be aware.\n\nMS has always done a nice job of putting together applications with a pretty front end, and Outlook has almost always led the way in that regard. Though pretty, Outlook suffers from a very confusing layout in terms of where to find various configuration settings. Making a preference change is rarely just a couple of clicks away; invariably it either requires knowing up front where things are or it requires a lengthy search for the desired setting.\n\nOutlook 2007 adds RSS feeds, a nice feature for those that use them. To be honest, I have not tried this feature so I cannot comment on it. That said, its availability is a nice thing and is something to consider if this capability is something you need or desire.\n\nI fiddled with the Business Contact Manager portion of the application and to me it feels like a light CRM implementation running on the local box. This is a nice thing to have, but unfortunately it is not something I personally need. For a person who relies on keeping track of contacts, sales and other vitals, I can see this as being a very useful tool.\n\nI do appreciate the fact that Outlook 2007 seems to be more stable than the last version I have used, but I do still get the occasional hang when connecting.\n\nOutlook 2007 is a nice package and with the integrated BCM it is a good tool for people who need to keep close track of their contacts.

{"words": "I picked up Outlook 2007 with Business Contact Manager because I needed a better way to track my customers' communications (I'm a work-at-home freelancer). I've been using it now as my primary e-mail client for about three months. So far, so good.\n\nI had little to no problems installing Outlook 2007. I'm using XP, and my Office suite is 2000. I like the GUI, but not all documents (especially Word and HTML docs) render as they do in their native apps, and I'm assuming this is because my other Office apps are getting way old.\n\nAlso, I appreciate that Outlook 2007 lets you add RSS feeds. I subscribe to many newsletter and blog reports and find this feature useful. I've had no problems with just the e-mail reading/organizing capabilities; everything there works just fine.\n\nLike many people writing reviews here, I'm disappointed that Outlook 2007 with BCM is so slow. I used to use Outlook Express as my e-mail client, which is pretty fast compared to Outlook 2007, so maybe it's just a matter of getting used to the new app.\n\nI was hoping this app would allow me to do more with billing and invoicing, but I've read a few blogs and discovered to get Business Contact Manager to really do all it can do (which is probably a lot), you'll need Microsoft Accounting installed, too. I'm considering buying that app, but I wish I didn't have to.\n\nThe full functionality of the app is a bit beyond me at this point (again, I'm upgrading from Outlook Express, so the learning curve is no surprise), but I hope this changes with time.

{"words": "I have been using this program on a PC with Office 2007 installed, and upgraded from Outlook 2003 with Business Contact Manager (BCM). Two POP3 accounts were managed, and about 100-125 business contacts were tracked. I have four years' worth of E-Mail stored, amounting to thousands of E-Mail messages.\n\nFor those contemplating an upgrade from Outlook 2003 with BCM, you should do so. BCM is a good idea, but the 2003 version (even after the service packs) were not as good as they could have been. The 2007 version is definitely an improvement in every way except speed, but I'll get to that in a moment.\n\nThe E-Mail features of Outlook 2007 are pretty good. The ability to set up rules to auto-process incoming messages is very good, much like the 2003 version. The search folders and new flagging options are very handy to make it easier to find messages according to a variety of filters/searches. The fact that you can flag a message for follow-up at a later time, and have that appear as a notification and on your to-do list is very handy. I have yet to make full use of all of those related features to the best of their potential.\n\nSpam filtering is a weak point, but no worse than in the 2003 version. The simplified profile-based filtering with the ability to set up white lists and black lists is very basic compared to more sophisticated bayesian filtering available in other packages. I installed the SpamBayes add-on filter (freeware) which uses Bayesian filtering, and it's much more flexible in classifying spam messages. Spam filtering is so important these days, and when freeware packages do it better than a $100+ product from the likes of Microsoft, the people at Redmond should be embarrassed.\n\nThe BCM works very well. Being able to track E-Mail messages, calendar events, to-do items, and other items to customers is very cool. I've not used other contact managers, so I don't know how it compares, but it serves my needs, so I haven't looked elsewhere.\n\nIts limited spam filtering ability is nothing compared to the speed issues encountered when incoming messages are retrieved from my two POP3 accounts. When the messages are being retrieved, Outlook stops cold. If you are typing a message, you can forget about continuing until the incoming messages are processed. It's incredibly frustrating to see a well-equipped machine brought to a halt, but that's exactly what happens. It's not a result of high CPU usage; a look at the CPU meter shows that neither processor meters is pegged when it happens.\n\nIt was really bad in 2003, and just a little better in 2007, but still not acceptable. I have tried many different things, including archiving more messages into the archive.pst file instead of the outlook.pst file, but the improvements were only minor.\n\nSome would consider Outlook to be the embodiment of evil. As a person who came from using unix-based E-Mail (pine and elm anyone?), to PMMail for both OS/2 and Windows, I didn't have any problem getting used to Outlook and appreciating the extra features it brought to the table. Like anything, it's more often the operator behind the keyboard than the software on the computer.\n\nOutlook 2007 with BCM is a good product, but it could, and should, be better.", "label": "bad review"}

You can tell it to break the back up into 2 GByte slices so you can keep the backup hard drive nicely decluttered by running Windows defrag program from time to time.  We have a Windows XP operating system and it works very well with that.  The program also allows you to create a disaster recovery CD and a corresponding disaster recovery backup on a hard drive.  You can set levels for compression and encryption and set password protection or not.  The more the compression and encryption, the longer the backup takes but the smaller and more secure it is (the default values are fine for me).  You can also adjust the intensity of the backup effort so it will run more slowly in the background so it won't interfere with you while you are using the computer or more quickly if you schedule the backups to be done at night (as I do).  The manufacturer was very responsive when I had some initial questions about it.  Unlike Norton Ghost, which we also have, it will not communicate on-line when you tell it not to.\n\nTo add to my initial review one year later (January 2010): in a year of ownership I have greatly benefited by learning to depend on the program's termination features. You can have it just run the backup on schedule and stop, or after the backup you can also set it to automatically perform \"power\" functions. These include shutdown, log off, Standby, and Hibernate (assuming you have configured your computer for Hibernate). What this means is that my copy of this program at work starts a backup a little after my normal office hours and shuts the computer down afterwards. So I get an incremental backup of the day's complete work without spending productive office time doing it and save energy by turning it off, too. At home I have it tuck itself into Standby after our normal bed time. So we get full use of the computer all day, a backup of the day's activities afterwards, and don't let it run up our utility bill, either. And Standby turns off the USB backup drive as well to preserve its longevity.  On the other end of the spectrum you can set it to wake up your computer from Standby to run a backup before you need to use the computer.  The settings also show up in the Scheduled Tasks for Windows XP and Windows Vista (unlike any of the Ghost products). We now have four licensed copies of Genie. It is easily a better backup tool than the others we have tried: Norton Ghost 10.0, Norton Ghost 14.0, Norton 360, DT Utilities' PC Backup Pro, or the native Windows XP and Windows Vista backup programs. Genie does what you tell it to, unlike Norton Ghost which has a fit because it missed one day's scheduled incremental backup or Windows Vista's native backup which will only restore the computer to the way it was when the backup was made and therefore requires the same size hard drives partitioned into volumes exactly the same way (sort of a joke because by the time a good hard drive wears out you find they do not make them that small anymore so you can not replace it with an identical hard drive!).", "label": "good review"}

Each base probably weighs a couple of pounds and seem very durable.....much better than the real thin, lightweight, flimsy base set.  On a flat gym floor, these will stay in place a lot better because of their weight.  They do a good job on the grass and are wonderful to throw in the trunk for possible pickup games with the kids (or their friends) or at a family picnic.  I guess if you really needed these bases to stick in the grass, I would recommend purchasing some 3/4\" or 1\" wide white webbing that's about 17\" long.  Use the poly/nylon webbing and some spikes to hold the webbing down over the bases.  You don't want to puncture the rubber bases because that puncture is just going to rip bigger and bigger.  My boys are only 5 and 7 yrs old so these are just fine.  If playing in the grass alot, I may have like to see Franklin make this same set in a neon/construction color orange.  The orange color would help make the bases pop a little more in the grass, and probably make them a little easier to see.  If the boys continue show interest in baseball and get older, I will make the investment for a more durable home plate with the 3-5 spikes in them so the home plate is thicker/heavier and stays in place during batting practice.  One improvement that I would like to see Franklin make on these rubber plates is to manufacture some heavy-duty \"tabs\" on the outside of the bases.  The tabs would have small holes in them so that you can use small ground spikes to anchor the bases down in the grass.  For home plate - use three tabs, you could have tabs on the front corners and at the back tip.  For the other bases, you could use four, but at minimum, have two tabs on opposite corners.", "label": "good review"}

Really, for the same price there are many products which are inferior as far as thickness & durability go. Also, the \"tread\" on the bottom helps keep the bases in place. Obviously, if the grass is wet or the dirt is dry, they're going to slip...these aren't designed to compare to a secured base. Don't have unrealistic expectations. Still, I'm loving our set & think it should make it through the season. They fit in one of my baseball gear bags, but then it becomes too heavy & no room for helmets or catcher's gear. Got a collapsable wagon for the bases, tee, net, & gear bag.  Some have complained about not having a pitchers mound.  It'd be a nice inclusion, but for tee ball, we don't need it.

Both of my boys are travel caliber and I have no worries of the ball going through the net on hard kicks.\n\nGood bang for the buck - if you're on the fence and you're buying for 16 & under crowd, it's a no brainer.\n\nUPDATE 8/2/13:  It's about 2 years later and this sucker won't die.  In my backyard braving the elements.  The net is still stopping balls. Only a few velcro attachments left, but ties seem to work better anyway.

I gambled on the junk Vivitar 7x50s for slightly less and they were a joke--hard to focus, very dark image. So I bought this bushnell for barely a ten spot more money. Wow, very bright image, focus dead on and easy. As others have said, this is all the binocular a casual user will need.

It is surprising how difficult it can be to find what you are looking for with powerful binoculars and a narrow field of view. I had a pare like that years ago and traded them as quick as I could.

The binoculars are little on the heavy side but easy to adjust focus and to use. The case and strap that came with the binoculars are of mediocre quality. It would have been helpful to have a more sturdy case and strap. Furthermore, you will need to attach the strap to the binoculars upon first use. Simply unfasten each of the buckles and slide each each end of the strap through the slots located at the bottom of the binoculars. Then, run them through the buckles twice before adjusting the length. The binoculars also come with a cleaning cloth and 4 lens covers.

Looking through them, you start to form an instant headache then realizing the image shift from one eye to the other is several feet off at 100'. all distances even up close the images between one eye and the other are off making these useless unless you decide to keep one eye closed at all times. Having said that, they make an ok scope, or if you have an eye patch, born with one eye, or just blind in one eye, cyclops, then it will be ok.

In order to do this, you must remove 3 screws from the sliding plate and remove the edge runner. The screws were impossible to remove, and even with an \"easy-out\" they would not come out. So Now I have a tool with 3 stripped screws. Just for information, I also tried the front face screws, which also would no budge. I'm guessing that even though the instructions require their removal to add the swing pin, these screws have been chemically locked in.\n\nAnd thats not all. The slide to adjust the edge position sticks badly and does not move smoothly. The minute adjustment is a joke since the overall slide binds so badly.\n\nOverall, I'd not wish this product on my worst enemy.

I was going to switch to another brand, and ended up sticking to this one because of how slick the paper holder works. It doesn't have those wire springs that can be painful on tired fingers. It uses a \"key\" to open a spring held brace that secures the sandpaper on either end. My old one never loosened under 25 years of use. I also save money by purchasing the larger single sheet paper and cutting them into quarters. I also never replaced the pads because they were so durable. I used to snag and rip the paper on splinters but the pad wore very little. This sander is not as light as most on the market, but I feel that it aids in sanding because it adds the pressure you need to do the job. The motor doesn't bog down very much with heavier pressure. The weight of the sander also helps to keep the sander in place and not jump around on the object. The cord is very heavy and the overall sander looks and feels very commercial. The grip is great even for my small hands. This review is written by a woman.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I have had a PC 340 for over ten years. I have used the 340 often and never felt I needed anything more for he limited amount of time I used a palm sander. Recently I began using the sander to sand Christmas ornaments. I found it perfect for the task, my R.O.S. was too aggressive. After getting bored with the frequency of changing between 150 and 220 grit paper I decided to buy a second sander. My initial plan was to buy another PC palm sander, currently the PC 380. As I researched online I noticed the overwhelming positive reviews of the PC 330. I decided to try it. I figured I could compare it to my 340 and If I did not feel it was worth the extra cost I could always take it back. I of course did not return the 330, I am considering buying a second one. The quality of the tool is obvious when you pick it up. Using the 330 Speed-Bloc in an enclosed garage is a substantially improved experience, if only for the comparably quiet operation. The weight of the sander aids in the ease of operation as well. I have found that less pressure is required to get an ornament properly sanded, less time as well. Other than the added cost, which appears well justified, I can find nothing to complain about, I have had no difficulty changing paper. I have just applied pressure with my fingers to the clamps, I have not used the provided tool yet. My only quandary  is justifying the purchase of a second 330 while my old 340 is still operational.", "label": "good review"}

I just wanted to post that if you want light weight, the air-powered dual-action sander isn't bad.  Use 50-grit sticky discs and plenty of compressed air (6hp and 230V is probably better.

{"words": "Update (2014): I still have two of these. They sit more than they get used. They are top notch tools of the highest quality. No changes to add to the review below. Just letting you know that the tools and myself are still valid and this tool is still available new.\n\nOriginal review (2002):\nThis machine works but is heavy, like other reviewers said. Myself and my coworker are each 6 foot tall men in good condition. We can barely put in 6 hours a day with the tool and that includes two half hour breaks to allow for muscles to stop spasming.\nBUT--if used correctly, this tool does remove paint. It is slow, paint dust goes everywhere, and you must wear a respirator mask and a face shield.\nContrary to the instructions included with the tool...--read this carefully--There are little adjustable rails on the left and right side of the disc. The rails can be lowered and raised to adjust the angle of attack of the disc. I found that the \"cutting\" side rail (leading edge rail) of the grinder needs to be set to about 1/16 inch above the grinding disc (leaving 1/16th inch of exposed disc to do the cutting) and the back side rail (trailing edge rail) needs to be about 1/16 of an inch TALLER than the total depth of the paint you are removing. (The back rail should ride along the painted surface, keeping the trailing edge of the disc off of the paint by 1/16th inch.) In my case I am removing approximately 1/8 inch of paint (typical for an 80 year old house). Therefore the trailing edge rail should be set 3/16th lower than the disc, leaving the trailing edge of the cutting disc suspended, by the rail, about 1/16th inch above the painted surface. The cutting edge (leading edge) of the disc is exposed, preventing the rail from riding along the painted surface, about 1/16th of an inch.\n\nThe measurements are made by laying a straight edge (I use a square) across the disc and raising and lowering the black rails to the appropriate height. This is very easy.\n\nPlan on using an inconspicuous place on your house and practicing for about 2 or 3 hours until you get it right. Don't give up. My first day was very frustrating. Lots of clogging. At first I could only use the tool for about 10 seconds before it totally gummed up. Uggh. But with practice, clogging (gumming) is actually quite minimal when you find the right \"angle of attack\" for your application. Gumming usually occurs when you hold the grinder in one place too long or try to cut too deeply in one pass. You can't expect to realistically remove more than about 1/64 of an inch per pass, maybe even as little as 1/128 of an inch per pass. This equates to about 4-6 passes, sometimes up to 10 passes for severely cupped and warped wood. But this type of use allows for almost constant grinding with very little gumming. When the tool does gum up use a small, wooden-handled ice-pick to \"pop\" the gum chunks off of the grinding disc. A cleaning session takes about 1-2 minutes or even less. An occasional brushing with a wire brush helps prevent re-gumming on paint covered, problem spots on the disc. This technique works so well that I only change the disc when the teeth wear down and stop cutting effectively (4-8 hours of use, depending). I have only soaked the discs in mineral spirits one time and generally find it unnecessary.\nBeware--this tool pulverizes the paint into a fine powder that goes everywhere. You will need ridiculous amounts of plastic drop cloths and bricks to hold them in place. Then you must sweep the powder at the end of each day. The amount that you collect is astounding. You can expect to collect about 10-20 gallons of paint powder from an average, 3BR/2Bath, one level home. This must be done for both legal and ethical reasons. Would you actually dump 10-20 gallons of lead and enamel paint into your yard?\nIn closing--this tool works great. It is a bear to use. You must use scaffolding. It is slow. Expect about three weeks of all day work to get your old house scraped and ready to prime. Buy lots of discs, about 10 for an average size house. Use only the 24 grit as the discs wear out and you need all the cutting power you can get. But beware as a new 24 grit disc cuts viciously and leaves severe swirl marks. But after about 10 minutes of use it wears down to a manageable level.\nIf you can afford it--replace your siding. New poplar siding is about 15 cents a foot (in 2005. Prices fluctuate) in the US. Materials for an average home would cost about $4,000. Plus lots of labor. Vinyl siding is usually a poor choice. It costs $5,000, looks fake, and causes weird moisture issues between the vinyl and the old siding.\nBut if you, like me, have little money and lots of time--this is the tool for you.\n(note: I post my reviews because I take them seriously and I take other people's seriously as well.

It is comfortable to use for prolonged periods of time. It can be used to round sharp edges and get into difficult spots as well as the normal flat surfaces.

{"words": "Well to start with I really wonderd if this tool was going to save me time removing 75 years of paint on my mother in laws house. I orderd it and went right to work with it,about 3 days later I had a large old ranch house down to bare wood and ready for priming. I found that the house had been at least 7 different colors in it 75 years. When using the the stripper  I also used a full face shield and a resperator along with a long sleeve shirt and I put a bib on so that i wouldnt have paint going down my shirt. I also found that the metal disc. would sometimes clog with paint, so I would take a propane torch and burn the paint of the disc and then continue on. I did end up wearing one disc plum out and so I bought a new disc to finish up with. The stripper is a little heavy and your arms are going to get tired but my wife used it after I suspended it with 4 long bungee cords above the location she was working. The bungee cords helped suspend the tool and take the weight off the user. Anyway, the tool is very well made and plenty powerful and it beats trying to use an acid stripper. I will probably use it next to strip the paint off the cabinets in the old house and then make new doors. I can see where a home owner buying an older house could really save alot of money buying this new tool. I build high end custom furniture so i really nit pick my tools not only in there upkeep but in their performance as well and i don't keep any tool that doesnt perform. This new Porter Cable does perform very well and I feel that if your need is for a tool like this the Porter Cable stripper is the only way to go.

{"words": "This is a really accurate easy to use router guide.

The pin to make it work as a circle guide was lost about a month after I bought the one at home.  One of the guys that works for me is a hobby machinist, so he is going to drill and tap the body, and make a plate for the end so we can store the extra parts in the guide.\n\nSecondly, the indicator sleeve could use hash marks at the 45-degree points, which would let you adjust to the nearest 128th of an inch, and interpolate to the 256th of an inch.

{"words": "I purchased this product with a new router hoping that it would provide a simpler, more portable and less expensive solution than a table mount for working around edges. I've been disappointed in two ways. First, the mounting is not nearly as positive as I would hope. Even with the screws firmly affixed, there is still a small amount of play between the guide and the router. This does not inspire confidence, and creates accuracy problems when using the guide fully extended. There's really no excuse for this, it's just poor QA. While you might expect some play from generic stuff, a brand-new Porter-Cable brand attachment ought to fit a brand-new Porter-Cable router snugly. Aside from the attachment interface, the quality of this attachment is very good, and the design thoughtful. Functionally, it has some limitations, which is my second qualm. I've found that the relatively small contact surface makes it difficult to keep this running flat again smaller stock, especially anything rougher. The contact surface thoughtfully includes holes for screwing in a board or a plastic block in order to make this surface larger, but this still won't help you with thiner pieces of work. If you are trying to rout both edges it is a real challenge to keep this small guide surface from riding up and ruining your work. Now, this really shouldn't shock anyone, I am describing a scenario where a table-mounted router is obviously the right tool for the job. But if you are hoping that this can give you router table functionality in an inexpensive package that you can easily carry with you, be aware that this is not the case.\n\nOverall this tool is great for certain applications, especially any work you need to do in place, where a router table is not an option. It's a good design overall, and rate as a 4-star tool by me if not for the play in the attachment interface.  I'd suggest potential buyers think about what they intend to use this attachment for. Personally I wish I'd saved my money for a bench-top table mount, but I can imagine others who would find this tool invaluable, especially if you do most of your routing on a jobsite instead of in a workshop.", "label": "bad review"}

It could have easily had more than an additional 2\" of travel with a simple design change. Or you could shorten the beam by 2\" and have the same usable travel with a design change. The pins that adapt it to the router are .014\" under size and the spread between the mounting holes on the router are .025\" more on the base than on the pin location on the edge guide. Now when you tighten the screws to fasten the router to the edge guide, they will cant the pins so they are not clamped parallel to the holes. This is shoddy quality control. Even the screws are an obsolete size which hasn't been used much for more than 25 years. The screw size by the way is #12-24. Most think it is a 5mm, but it is not. I make the assumption they got an extremely good price on these obsolete screws. These damned screws if you can find them are over $2 per screw at a place that sells parts for this edge guide online.

Something, anything would help especially with so much dust control regulations being imposed by various government agencies, work place safety boards, fire marshals and insurance companies.\n\nOther than that a great tool that will basically last forever.

{"words": "I've been using this sander since 1976.  Back then, it was made by Rockwell.  Porter Cable bought out their tool division several years ago.  They know a timeless design when they see one and this sander needed no improvement.  This is a heavy, heavy duty orbital sander.  It uses its own weight to do the job.  Using half sheets of sand paper, it cheaper to operate over the long run over having to buy round sheets that come 4 or 6 to a pack and can be pricey.\nSince I've owned this unit, I've only had to replace the power cord, thats it, and it was in a production shop environment for 3 years.  I have used it in place of a belt sander at times, with an aggressive grit paper, its that good.  Highly recommended for the serious wood worker.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I'm going to take the contrarian view on this edge guide. I'm pretty much a gadget freak, and this guides combination of sturdy construction, lockability, and fine adjustment won me over enough to buy one for my 690. On use, I found it is a mixed blessing.\n\nI have a pretty solid router table setup, so by primary use for this kind of widget is on wood pieces that simply can't be worked that way, i.e., edging tabletops. What I found is that the guide takes my 690, which serves as my simple lightweight hand tool, and makes it a bit awkward and weighty. Admittedly it is more accurate once set up, but so is my older, far less flashy edge guide once I get it set up. Think of it as one step forward, two steps back.\n\nAnd the real truth is that relying on a heavy aluminum straight edge guide or using bits with standoff bearings really does everything I need. A lot of your reaction to this guide will be determined by how you work. For me, nearsighted and chubby, it forces me to far back from the edge to feel comfortable. Someone who is comfortable working a router from the side might think this is the cat's pajamas.\n\nWhich brings up my final point. Don't assume that, just because a tool is cool or feature heavy that it will work for you. Take the time to think about how you work and if it will fit in. Too often something I thought was going to be utterly wonderful wound up living on the top shelf.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "This is edge guide is very accurate, it's easy to mount and use.\nI originally bought the smaller cheaper guide. It was too small with only a narrow contact against the wood. It wasn't very long so it was harder for me to feel it making contact with the wood. I ended up getting this at a later time when I large project came along.\nThis guide is more substantial. It has larger contact surfaces, great adjustment and some weight which helps you maintain control of the router. I don't feel that it's awkward weight, just something substantial that helps control the tool.\nI actually ripped a long piece or material and screwed it along the edge to increase the stability. It has holes machined in its face which allow you to do just that if you think you need it. Most cases you probably won't. I just happened to need a longer fence.\nAnother plus is that it will fit the new 890 series so I didn't have to get another fence when I added this router to my collection.", "label": "good review"}

Unless you are routing dados on a well supported surface, it's weight and power pretty much requires table mounting. It is too hard to control doing edges. The table mounting is where the shortcomings are noticed. The weight will cause a normal MDF router table to sag fairly quickly if it's left in place, so make sure you mount it on a removeable plate; and remove it when not in use. I mounted a Router Raizer on mine to allow height adjustment from above, but in either case it won't plunge enough to allow me to change bits from the top of the table without modification to the (hardened) wrenches.

It compares all  of the big boys.\nIt has a great soft start 3 1/4 hp motor that has five  speeds and will handle any bit and wood combination I've thrown at  it.\nThe router's base will allow for 3 3/8\" bit diameters. Most of  the other 3 hp models will only handle 2 1/2\" diameter bits. This is  good if you want a router to use on a table to run panel bits or large  moulding bits.\nThe router's downfalls are that it doesn't lend itself to  be conveneint to use on a router table. The plunge lock lever needs to be  pushed and held all the time while you are adjusting the depth. Makes you  wish you had a third hand. It also does not have a shaft lock, so bit  changes require two wrenches.\nIt does have a trigger switch that is  handle mounted. (a must have for any router) and you can order a dust  attachement from Porter Cable to hook up to your shop vac.\nWhat I've  learned about this router is that you need a second router to do hand held  work for trimming laminate and doing small routing work. (1/2\" bit  diameter and less) This one at 20 pounds is too heavy for hand held work.  My suggestion would be to get a good 1 1/2 or 2 hp model for lighter jobs.", "label": "good review"}

The foam backing pad is really thick and plush so it can handle corners and edges without squaring them.\n\nThe paper locks are the strongest I've ever seen.

If you have a garage shop as I do, you'll have to keep it in the house until you use it.\n\n2) No dust extraction - use a downdraft table, mask, etc.\n\n3) If you are not using PSA or hook-loop, you probably will want to put 3-4 pieces of sandpaper in at a time so you don't spend so much time swapping new paper in.\n\n4) The paper changing tool is something you do NOT want to misplace.  Zip tie it to your power cord.\n\n5) The paper changing tool works better if you put it in a vise and bend the top inch about ~10 degrees.\n\n6) The sander is taller than most 1/4 sheet sanders - this can make it harder to get into corners or small spaces.\n\n7) \"Break\" your paper to improve it's life (run it across an edge to flex the grains)  This also makes it easier to fold and tear", "label": "good review"}

For shier cutting, power and sanding ability nothing I have used in over 30 years of carpentry can match the Porter Cable 330 palm sander when a palm sander is the tool of choice. On the downside the Sticky pad for this sander does not hold up well. The glue on paper tends to tear the pad when removing.

Hook and loop paper might be a better choice but the H&L paper in 4x4 sheets is not readily available.\nI have read many reviews of palm sanders in which the user complains that they have trouble with them when sanding drywall.

The old 330 has a metal housing, where as this one is plastic. Granted, on a cold day the plastic is probably more friendly, but I like the feel of the metal housing better.\n\n2.) The new 330 isn't made in the U.S.A., where as the old one is. For the price, it should be made here.\n\n3.) The new 330 is rated at 14,000 RPM, where as the old one is 15,000. This probably makes the brushes and bearings last longer, although the brushes don't seem to be the same quality as on the older unit. Either way, the extra 1,000 RPM helped a lot when trying to avoid swirl marks with a course grit. The 340 is also 14,000 RPM, but 1/2 the price.\n\n4.) The new 330 isn't counter-balanced as well as the old, perhaps because of the lighter plastic case.\n\n5.) The 330 doesn't have a dust collection system, unlike the 340. Granted, if you buy a 330 you probably have a downdraft table and don't want the drag of the vacuum hose to interfere with the feedback of the sander, but it would still be nice.\n\n6.) You pretty much need the tool to install the sandpaper. Everyone I know (including me) who has a 330 uses PSA paper because of this. Bosch has an ideal setup on their 1297DK, which is also a nice sander, but 12,000 RPM.\n\nWith that said, this is still the best unit available for purchase that I've found. The hand grip is very comfortable, it's fairly quiet, and the vibration is low enough to not cause numbness after extended periods of sanding.

This flashlight is well balanced and feels nice in the hand and turns on and off easily with the thumb of the hand holding the light.  My only complaint is that it eats the battery up pretty fast.

I have several cordless tools from different makes, so I'm not using up the batteries all the time like I'm supposed to from what I've read, but having this flashlight around helps me at least cycle through my DeWalt 12V batteries.  The flashlight has a lightweight feel to it without the battery installed, so it clerly doesn't feel as \"heavy duty\" or solid as, let's say, a drill might feel, but I figure what should I expect?  Maybe the yellow and black color scheme along with the DeWalt label makes me expect more?  But, heck, it's only a flashlight!  You can't vary the beam width as you can with a MagLite but you can pivot the head which has proven useful at least once.  Lastly, I'm not quite sure how I ever got by without a flashlight in the shop!  My final recommendation is that if you have a cordless kit from any make, get the matching accessory flashlight!", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I began woodworking 10 years ago.  8 years ago I bought my first 7539 Porter Cable.  Today I am still using that same router.  I purchased a milling machine that works with a router.  I went to a local tool shop and told them I needed a strong router that would need to run for long periods of time.  They told me PC was a workhorse and probably the only router that could take such abuse.  They did not lie.  I have milled 5 - 6 foot long, 6\" diameter posts with this router making spiral plunge cuts.  I have run this baby for sometimes 10 minutes non-stop -- often -- and she never gives up.  I was so impressed I purchased this router for my table as well.  I use the table more than the milling machine -- raised panels doors mostly.  The one in the table lasted 5 years without ever changing the brushes.  What killed it was the freak flood during Hurricane Ike.  I live in Texas along the gulf coast.  I got 2-1/2 foot nasty water in my garage -- enough to submerge the motor.  I did not think to take the router out of the table before evacuating.  But even so, when I got home I plugged it in just to see if it would work.  I could hear the motor winning but no spin.  I gave the arbor a good tap with a hammer and guess what -- the router started spinning.  I could not believe it.  I sprayed it down (the motor, through the vents) with w-d 40 and set out to see how long it would last.  I got a whole year out of it!  But finally the corrosion won and she died for good.  So now I will purchase another one and next time I have to evacuate I will make sure to pull it out of the table and tuck it away in the attic. I have no idea if Porter Cable has continued the excellent construction of this router or if they have cheapened it, but I will find out with this new one.  I will stick with what I know, and if they fail me, only then will I look elsewhere.\n\nI am back a little more than 2 years since I bought this router and it is holding up very well.  I've used bits up to 2 inches in diameter for raise panel work and the router has done great.  The one that I had on my milling machine is still there and still working!  It sat unused for a whole year and I just recently fired it up to mill finials for some gable trim I am currently making.  I was worried that it may have froze up after sitting for so long but the motor started up as soon as I hit the switch.  Thank you Porter Cable!", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Excellent router.  Nice motor.  The soft start is good.\n\nNot critical but the bit changes could be updated.  I like doing things the old fashioned way and using wrenches to change the bits doesn't bother me.\n\nWe've used this to turn large paneling bits.  Most recently an enormous one that we had custom made.  It handles it perpendicular to the grain with as little strain on the motor as could be anticipated.\n\nI'm knocking a start for safety.  I don't like that the switch is on the top of the router.  The top is proud of the switch, so if you set the router upside down, it won't hit the switch.  Still I see our carpenters often holding the router against themselves as the use the wrenches to tight the router bits in place.  I can't help picturing their bellies somehow hitting the switch and sending parts flying.  With good safety practices those parts will be wrenches and not finger tips.", "label": "good review"}

Definitely will upgrade to the aluminum auto lift base soon as I expect the weight of this router to bow the phenolic after a time.  This Router will easily turn 3\" panel bits and the adjustable speed controls make it easy to meet bit specs.  The only thing I did not like was the thumb screw style clamp on the base.  Really PC?  Never heard of a cam lock?  If anything will have to be replaced with use it will be the thumb screw.  This router was everything I heard it was both from other owners and online reviews.

Unfortunately, ours had a mishap this year (got too close to a lightbulb), and I needed to quickly replace him. I was impressed with Amazon at the speed with which he arrived. However, the new one looked NOTHING like the old one!! The quality of the painting was sub-par and messy, and the face shape, paint colors, eye shape, and hair were not as colorful or cute as our original one. The felt used for the body and hat on the new one is cheaper and rougher, more of a thick, scratchy felt than the soft one we had. He just seemed so dull and cheap, comparatively. Sadly, it seems they have let the quality go in favor of mass production. Luckily, only the body of ours had been damaged, so I was able to do a full head transplant, and my kids were none the wiser. When my kids noticed these new ones in the stores this year, they actually commented on how different they looked from theirs at home! Additionally, I looked for just the elf without the book, but found that I had to repurchase the entire set, so now I have an extra book and box.

Every morning he comes back and hangs out in a new spot.  Just one rule: \"You can't touch this - Hammertime!\" or he might lose his magic.\n\nThe elf isn't bendy or velcroed or anything, so it was difficult to pose him anywhere except a shelf.  For this amount of money, couldn't you at least make his hands velcro together?\n\nLastly, my kids were not into it (Age 2 and 3).  Maybe they were too young, or too spoiled.

The book is ok, we only read it once a year when he arrives (from storage....um the North Pole) however it does not give a ton of background information on him. The website you link with is great!\n\nI do have once concern, he has no feet, I am guessing because it would cost more to put create them.", "label": "good review"}

My wife of course then has to hide it again so when she gets home from school, it's search time again.  For it to be worth while, you (the adult??) has to be dedicated to hiding it as many times as possible and putting it in amusing positions.\n\nDon't underestimate your child.  Hide it where it is visible but make it challenging.  I really believe these kids today are much sharper than we were and they love the exitement of the search.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "As a mom, I often find myself with not much to do. Once the kids go to bed for the night, I'll sit there wracking my brain for new ways to entertain them. Elf on a Shelf inspires me to be more creative late at night, during the holidays, when I used to waste time wrapping gifts, watching TV, or enjoying a Hot Toddy with another adult. Did the kids even know I loved them before we had the Elf?!  It's a scary thought, but maybe they didn't. Christmas without the Elf is just a few weeks filled with anticipation, candy, shopping, a long school vacation, hot chocolate, cookie decorating, tons of exciting gifts, staying up late watching Christmas movies, sledding, ice skating, gingerbread house building, puzzle building with cousins in front of roaring fires...Like many moms it has me asking, \"But what am *I* supposed to be doing?\" That's why night-time is Elf Time. During the day, I keep an eye on Pinterest for new ideas. I got a lot of study time in during The Nutcracker with my kids the other night. Currently, I'm at the preschool potluck, and planning some super epic mischief for our Elf to get into!! Sometimes we moms simply need to put in a little elbow grease to create those unique holiday traditions that bind families together. That's what Elfing does for us. I might be tired and stressed out from wrecking my kitchen or the family car to make a single cute Facebook post, but it all will be worth it when I see the kids' surprised amusement for those five, glorious minutes.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "This is our first year using Elf on the Shelf. Our boys are almost 2.5 and 10 months old. Our toddler LOVES to look for \"Jingle\" every morning. It's so fun to see how excited he gets. He loves his little elf. We read the story during bed time every night as well (along with several others). I loved that the book mentions children saying their prayers. I feel like it's a great way to merge the fun Christmas traditions with our Christian beliefs and offer the Children a special tradition they will hopefully pass on one day. The elf is adorable and the perfect size for hiding and posting. We kept his hands sewn together because it's easier to hang him in different areas. I'm glad we waited until our son was big enough to enjoy the Elf and am looking forward to next year when we can play with both boys. There are lots of cute ideas for Elf posing on Pinterest and I've come up with a few on my own as well. We take our nightly picture of our son with Jingle before bed so we can keep track of all the hiding places. It will be fun to look back on as well each year. Great idea and love that this product started as a family tradition with sisters and they shared their tradition with all of us.", "label": "good review"}

Thought I could buy one used for less but couldn't find one for less than a brand-new one in the box.  This is going to be a generational tradition.  When I was a kid (back in the late 40s to the 50s, our mom told us about the elf watching our behavior and reporting back to Santa.  She would see him and point, but before we could turn our heads, he disappeared!  This may be one of the best parental tools EVER.

{"words": "Packaging and book is nice. Elf is of low quality. Made of stiff cheap rough felt. The hands are sewn together not Velcro or magnetized and the limbs do not have wire as the older knee hugger characters have thus making it impossible to keep in a pose or hang on most things that you would need to separate the hands to get his arms around. Mine also came with a rub mark on the cheek where paint had been rubbed off. My 17 month old does love to look at it and make him sit up, but it won't last long if I let him play with it. I was really hoping to be able to pose him more easily as that is the main reason I bought him.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "We're now on our second elf in four years and the newest model (2014) is made differently than the 2009 or 2010 model we had before.  Why would we need a second elf when we only have one kid you ask?  Well, because the clothing these little elves (demons) wear is not prone to burning off when placed next to a light bulb.  Yes, not a good idea for the elf to hide within a ceiling light fixture because it is a tricky place to find him...when forgetful parents later turn the light on to mop the floor.  The next time our elf moved to a new location in our house, he had a hole in his pants.  So, don't permit these elves to hide near incandescent light bulbs.\n\nAs for the differences, the facial complexion is now more natural, the head is more round and less like a freaky clown with less makeup, and the elf has beanie baby type filler in his butt to help him sit up better than the older elves with less junk in their trunks.", "label": "good review"}

We've had him say \"Good morning\" in flour. He's zip-lined and hidden in a bowl full of candy canes. He's even dangled from our cabinets by a candy cane. So much fun for your child when they wake up.\n\nOh, some people compared the Elf on the Shelf with Christopher Pop-kins. Well, we bought both! I bought another one because when one of my kids found the Elf on the Shelf the other three would be so bummed. So now every year both of them get into mischief together.

{"words": "This Director's Cut is the only version of this game you should own, simply because it supports the Analogue joysticks on the Playstation controller. The control in the other versions is impossible at times, and a bugger to learn if you are a first time player.\nThe game by itself is excellent. Lot's of puzzles, and lots of Zombies to shoot down. There are times (many of them, actually) where you much be careful how many zombies you shoot, because you can run low on bullets very quickly. The story is standard for any Survival Horror game: A group of soldiers are locked in an old mansion that is infested with zombies. An evil company has eperimented with a chemical that turns people into zombies, and the fallout turns the WHOLE TOWN into zombies. To survive, you must make your way through the mansion, and solve all the puzzles. This is definitely a challenge, and one that can be frustrating at times, but rewarding once completed.\nHere are the pros. The graphics are superb. The detailing of the zombies and the surroundings give you are real sense of dread, and yes, the blood flow is well detailed, it sprays when you are wounded. The music is ominous and ambient, giving just the right mood to the situations you come across. The story is also well put together, even though anyone who has seen George Romero's \"Living Dead\" trilogy (and what horror fan hasn't?) can get a sense of deja vu. All these elements make this a game well worth getting.\nNow for the cons. This game is not the toughest game for the Playstation, but it can be darn frustrating when you get stuck. Sometimes, a puzzle is very tricky and requires you to back-track just to see if you missed anything. This adds much more time to the game, but not in a good way. There is also the frustration of running low on bullets when there are three zombies coming towards you. Each zombie requires about three bullets each to finish them off, but bullets are so scarce that you must conserve. Also, the acting and dialogue is so hammy that it is comical, and you feel compelled to just skip through it so you can get back to killing zombies.\nOverall, this is a great game with a few shortcomings. But then again, nothing is perfect. If the Survival Horror concept sounds appealing, then you should check this one out. The \"Resident Evil\" series has become the benchmark of Survival Horror much like \"Final Fantasy\" has for the RPG genre.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I love this game. The story is great, and draws players in. So what if the voice acting is terrible!? The graphics are so so, but the atmosphere is terrific. I remember the first time I played it; a few rounds in my pistol with a knife, and no healing items, walking down a dark corridor and hearing a window shatter. It was possibly the best time I could ever have playing a game. Two characters, with different story lines, and hidden surprises everywhere, Resident Evil is a classic. You won't be disappointed.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "this puts the most recent code veronica x to shame.  it has the best story and best scare factor.  sure, the graphics may lack a little, but its the original, first of its kind.  i recommend playing this game before playing any more re titles so the stories actually make sense.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "This is where the epic Resident Evil series began. The first adventure see's you tackle zombies, snakes and dogs in a deserted mansion, which is very atmospheric. Don't be put off by the relatively poor voice acting and cut scenes, bear in mind that this was made in 1995/1996 and so for the times it's pretty good. This is a classic game that spawned one of the best series' of games on the Playstation. The only thing preventing this from being a 5 star game is the slighty disapointing ending. But this is only a minor flaw, and this is still one of the best games on the Playstation.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "THis is the amazing game that started the genre of \"survival horror\" and created the interest in fans for such games.  This game is pretty old now, but if you haven't played it yet you'll surely want to give it a try.  The point to this game is simple: survive a mansion full of zombies, while solving puzzles along the way.  What makes this game a challenge is the fact that you have to fend off enimies with a very limited amount of health and life. ANother challenge is that occasionally enimies will pop out and give you a surprise which you must quickly defend against.  ANother great thing is that on this version of the game you get a special edition of Resident Evil and a harder difficulty level.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Since last night I've been waiting to do this review, because I've been studying the exact differences from RE2 and RE Directors Cut. This review will really help for someone who has played RE2 but is wondering what RE DC is about. Well, you've came to the right place.  First of all, here are the facts:\n1. Each zombie takes 5 shots NO MATTER WHAT. (with the Beretta)\n2. Jill is a blonde all though she doesn't look like it (a very dumb blonde)\n3. BARRY HAS A MAGNUM AND HES PROUD!!!\n4. You have to kill zombies up to four times if you leave the room when you shoot them down. (that means they come back alive once they are dead and you leave the room...the just pop up!)\n5. This game has hilarious dialogue!\n  Well, speaking of dialogue, the grammar is also very bad...and I mean VERY bad. Examples are: (when you pick up the 1st floor map)  \"You got the 1st floor map\"  RE2 says \"you've taken the 1st floor map\" that makes more sense.  \"You got the acid rounds\"...funny sometimes. Also, what I found is that Jill doesn't know what blood is. Barry is inspecting a pool of red liquid on the dining room floor. Jill comes over and has the nerve to ask \"What is it?\" and she stays there and studies it...??? Barry replies with \"I THINK it is blood. I hope this is not Chris's blood!\"  And they have exaggeration at the completely wrong times. But when there is a big monster coming they just talk \"wow. its a monster. what do we do?\"  and when there is like a door that doesnt open (during movie scenes) they say \"THIS DOOR WONT OPEN!! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO??\" Also, a really hilarious part is when Barry hands Jill the acid rounds Jill says that he should keep them for himself, and Barry replies \"No that's okay...I have THIS!!!\" And holds up his Magnum...I laughed my head off...he sounded so stupid! No offence to the makers of RE or anything but it is just so funny!\n  Another fact is that the camera angles are bad, but the puzzles are harder. Hmmm? Resident Evil is a very very very good game...but it is just the dialogue and camera angles...ive been talking it down but now its time to tell you that it is DEFINATELY worth getting, despite it's happy mediums.\nSo theres a few final things I have to say here:\n1. Barry has a magnum 2. Wesker has shades 3. And the three zombies at the top of the stairs above the M Storeroom 1F sound like cows.\n  Cheers! ~Jongles", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "...\n Resident Evil : Directors Cut is a enigma in itself.  Now why do I say that?  Well basically this is not a Directors Cut because capcom messed up.  The only people who officially got a Director's cut is Japan and thier initial release of Biohazard (Resident Evil in Japan).  What we are missing is actually about 14 seconds in 2 different videos you see thru the game.  In the opening video, 10 seconds is missing which actually makes the video more graphic when Joseph dies by one of the zombies dog's and some of the characters are smoking.  In the second video where you meet your first zombie, you see a more graphic depiction of the zombie eating Kenneth.  But is it really worth it?  Most Gamers don't even know about it much less care, but collectors and true fanatics are really steamed about it.\n The STORY is very well done I can say.  Even though it does not really keep pace within the game, it is very interesting and revives a cult classic monster....zombies!  Vicious murders have plauged the town of Racoon City and it is up to the S.T.A.R.S (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) to find out where the source of these murders are coming from.  You take on the role as Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine and attempt to investigate a house infested with things that go bump in the night.  Get ready to immerse yourself in the game that started the genre - Survival Horror.\n The GAMEPLAY is what to can be expected from a game like this.  You will be jumping and many scenes in this game for it will spook the life out of you.  I know you are saying...this is just a game....its more than that, trust me.  You basically navigate your character throughout the game solving various puzzles to gain access to different areas.  You will find plenty of ammo and weapons to help you battle the many monsters you will come up against.  Other S.T.A.R.S member will be around to help you out....others will try to block your way.  Although the controls are very hard to get used to, eventually you can compensate in many situations.  You will battle zombies, dogs, crows and the dreaded M-121A's....the Hunters.  But don't think you won't have the weapons to defend yourself for you will be armed with 9mm, shotgun's, a Colt Pyton and a fantastic Missle Launcher.\n The GRAPHICS are what to be expected for this game.  I personally saw no problem with the graphics.  Many people complain about the camera angles, but to me the camera angles added more spook to the game.  The Hunters still looked scary as heck with the limited graphics.  Many of the cutscenes are shown within the game engine, but the opening and ending actually have real actors.  Yes the dialouge is cheezy, but what do you expect?\n Overall I really enjoyed this game even though it took me a long time to get around to playing it.  I still cannot get over how much Wesker in the opening movie looks like Val Kilmer from Top Gun.  It had me jumping in a lot of areas and the puzzles were not too difficult. A great game and a great buy.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "In fact, I always tended to enjoy this one more than the previous, due to the fact that they made it less frustrating at times.\n\nIn this game, Crash \"helps\" Cortex to \"save the world\" by collecting crystals, despite the fact that Crash's sister, Coco, knows Cortex's true intentions. However, Crash doesn't know until near the end, due to a terrible signal quality.\n\nThe gameplay and design has changed a lot with this title. Crash can now use the circle button to duck, slide when moving and crouch jump. There are less levels, but they are divided into five Warp Rooms with five levels each (with a bonus warp room included). Plus you can actually save whenever you please!\n\nAlong with these, there are also more level settings, whether it would be the woods, the cold, the sewers, even the ruins. Remember when you rode the hog in the first game? Well, this time, you ride a polar bear cub instead.\n\nYou still collect gems in this game, but the mandatory ones are the crystals mentioned before in each level, which are easy to obtain. You still will receive a box gem for destroying every box (even the new Nitro boxes which should not be touched until you reach the green ! switch), except you can use up as many extra lives as you want and still get the gem as long as each box is destroyed. The color gems still serve the same purpose, even though there are only 5. The gems are more challenging to get and will still give you a reason to keep playing.\n\nWhile this game may seem a bit short, it is still a fun platformer released in the PS1 days.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Lets go back in time to one of my favorite PlayStation icons: Crash Bandicoot. For those who don't know, Crash Bandicoot is a fictional Eastern Barred Bandicoot who was genetically enhanced by the evil Doctor Neo Cortex who then escaped and set out to stop the evil scientist and his plans. Crash would appear in many games, but the ones I hold dear are the original three on the first PlayStation: Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. With that said, lets take a look at the first one in the series.\n\nThe first Crash Bandicoot game was released way back in 1996 with Naughty Dog developing the game, Sony Computer Entertainment publishing it and Universal Interactive Studios being the distributors. It was a PlayStation exclusive, but would eventually get re-released as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store to be played on the PlayStation 3. The game is definitely kid friendly and appropriate for all ages, Crash Bandicoot is basically a Mario ripoff but a very good one none the less who came up with several original ideas. The story goes that Crash Bandicoot was created by Doctor Neo Cortex and his henchmen Doctor Nitrus Brio. Crash escapes the experiments but leaves his girlfriend Tawna in the process and Crash is swept up to an island and sets out to go rescue her and stop the villains. Whats weird is that this is the only Crash Bandicoot game on the PlayStation in which Tawna appears in, I don't know why though, its definitely unusual. But nonetheless, lets continue with the game.\n\nThe first thing that stands out are the graphics, the graphics for 1996 looked fantastic, they were even better than Super Mario 64 on Nintendo 64 which was released a month later. It definitely gets an A+ for presentation. The game was a huge hit and was the first non-Japanese game to achieve commercial success in the country. Now, lets discuss the actual gameplay.\n\nThe game is nonetheless a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across three islands to defeat Doctor Cortex and rescue your girlfriend. The game is split into levels with one basic goal: get to the end without dying. You start out with four lives and its one hit deaths from being touched by enemies or falling into water or a pit. Yeah, its weird how water kills Crash even though he fell in the water at the introduction and was floating away to one of the islands and survived. Why is it that these characters who are very athletic cant figure out how to swim? I hate games that do this because when you see water, you're never sure if the game will allow you to swim. Its stupid and whats weird is that in the third game Crash does swim underwater with scuba gear. So really the game is a huge contradiction of itself.\n\nYou can get more one ups by finding them across levels or collecting 100 apples which are basically the coins of Super Mario Bros, but the apples are everywhere in this game so its really easy to get a one up, you could literally get at least three lives per level. Attack moves include jumping in the air and landing on an enemy or using a spin move in a tornado fashion to knock enemies off-screen, I like that, even if its a rip-off of Super Mario World. You also find this Mask that helps you on your journey, if you find it, it gives you an extra hit point, but you don't actually wear the mask it just follows you. If you get three masks without losing one, you turn invincible for a brief time much like the Starmans in Super Mario Bros.\n\nThe boxes are also a rip-off of Super Mario Bros. in which they have question marks on them and you have to destroy the boxes to gain prizes. But not all boxes are the same, there are boxes without question marks, arrow boxes that propel you in the air, boxes with exclamation marks which makes boxes appear out of nowhere, checkpoint boxes that act as a save spot for the level and TNT boxes which explode after three seconds when you jump on them, whatever you do, don't spin attack them because they will immediately explode.\n\nA strange feature in these boxes is that you can get Tawna tokens that act as a bonus level so you can get some extra fruit and one ups. Whats weird is that Tawna is in this level but she doesnt let you rescue her for some odd reason, but whats even stranger is that completing the bonus level is the only way to save the game or get a password. I don't understand why early PlayStation games didn't allow you to save anytime you want. Every video game that can support a memory card should do that, I hate writing down passwords so I can continue. But the password is only eight digits and the main buttons on the PlayStation controller act as the characters so its at least not a long and annoying password.\n\nIf you complete an entire level without losing a life and manage to destroy all the boxes, youll get rewarded with a gem, this was a flaw with the game because it makes the game way too damn hard and every future Crash Bandicoot game let you get the gem even if you die as long as you break all the crates. Some gems can act as platforms to help you get across areas that are impossible to reach, much like the vine in Super Mario Bros.\n\nNow while this game has some flaws, its still a good game overall, its not as good as the second and third game, but its definitely fun and enjoyable. The creativity is good, has a good challenge and the graphics are fantastic. If you have a PlayStation Network account, give this game a chance, its only $6 on the PlayStation Store so its not expensive or anything. Its definitely a classic.\n\nFINAL RATING:  8 out of 10", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Note: This review was written as if the game was just released\n\nDragon folklore is derived from 2 backgrounds: European and Chinese. Stories of these mythical beasts have been passed down for generations, with each culture passing down different stories about these flying animals. The 2 cultures have intertwined in recent years, due to more contacts throughout the world. Although it is difficult to pinpoint exact origins for these creatures, they have still remained popular through various mass media, such as books and films.  This game, however, is not the average dragon story.\n\nWhat This Game is All About:\n Spyro is the little dragons name and flaming minions is his favorite game. At the beginning of the story, the player watches a cut scene with an elderly dragon answering questions for an unseen interviewer. He mentions how there are 6 worlds in the dragon kingdom with 14,000 gems worth of treasure. There is also a very mean guy, who guys by the name of Gnasty Gnorc. After the dragon says some rude insults about Gnasty, Gnasty gets mad. Gnasty fires spells at all of the dragons in the Dragon Realm, freezing them all to stone. He also turns some of the treasure into his personal minions, which account for the enemies that Spyro must face throughout the game. It is up to him to restore order back to the Dragon World.\n\n The objective of the game is relatively simple: free dragons, find treasure, and defeat Gnasty Gnorc. In order to free a dragon, Spyro just has to walk up to him, however, not all of the dragons are just located out in the open. Some got frozen in very unfortunate spots, making the journey a little more difficult than expected. There are a total of 80 dragons to free, with between 12 and 16 scattered through each world. There is also 14,000 gems worth of treasure. The gem values are as follows: Red=1, Green=2, Blue=5, Yellow=10, and Purple=25. These are the 2 main collectables of the game, but there are also dragon eggs. Thieves run around taunting Spyro about how they have an egg, which in retrospect isn't a very smart thing to do to a dragon. There are 12 eggs scattered throughout the first 3 worlds, while the last 3 worlds have the little rascals running around with treasure instead. All of this count towards 100% completion of the game, and the player needs a set amount in order to progress to each world.\n\nGameplay:\n Spyro controls rather well, but there is one constant problem throughout the game; the camera is, to put it frankly, garbage. Maybe that is a little harsh, but after 6 worlds of it, it gets on someones nerves. It is especially annoying when I glide, by hitting the X button twice, and I cant see where Im going, so I end up falling to my death. The player can control the camera with L2 and R2, but it doesnt go very fast, so he or she ends up having to wait for it to catch up with him or her. As for Spyros moves, they are swell. He can charge at enemies or flame them, but he cant just do this to every enemy. Some enemies have metal, so they must be charged at, while others are too big to be charged, so they must be flamed. Although the enemies are different in each world, this is the basic pattern, but it doesnt get redundant. Some of the enemies animations are actually pretty funny.\n\n Spyros health system is unique. He has a dragonfly, of course, that follows him around. Every time Spyro takes a hit, his color changes, from yellow to blue to green. When Sparx, the dragonfly, is gone, Spyro has one hit left. Spyro can refill Sparxs health by attacking local animal fodder, which release butterflies to heal Sparx and, therefore, protect Spyro. It is a unique system.\n\n There are 6 levels in each of the first 5 worlds. There is a hub level, which leads to the other 5, a flying level (more on that in a bit), 3 main levels, and a mini-boss level (more on that as well). Each level has treasure for Spyro to collect and the only levels that have no dragons to free are the flying levels. The main levels are fairly linear, but they have some diverging pathways for Spyro to explore (and maybe find some secrets, too).\n\n The flight levels are a blast. Spyro starts out flying, and he has to go through, burn, or destroy 32 different assortments of objects, with 8 objects times 4 types. The player is timed, but getting each object adds more time. While these levels are all under 2 minutes long, they are still fun, but there isn't much incentive to replay them for a better time. The record should be its own reward, but there are only 5 of these levels, and the player can only view them by going back to the level. Aside from that, they are still very fun.\n\n The bosses in the game are severely lacking. The only boss that must be defeated is Gnasty Gnorc, so the other 5 are entirely optional. They are usually located towards the middle of the level, with each hit Spyro marks upon them driving them closer to the end. The fights are okay, but I feel that something couldve been added to make them more worthwhile, instead of just being a chase and burn battle.\n\n There are 2 power-ups in the game that Spyro can obtain. The first is a super charge ability, gained by running on super charge tracks. These are used very effectively to find some well-hidden secrets. The other isn't as apparent, but it is still fun. It is a super flame that is granted by a fairy. This ability allows Spyro to burn metal objects and enemies, along with making him red. Both are fun and well used.\n\nThe gameplay is still awesome, but they couldve most definitely refined the camera, and maybe done a better job with the boss battles, but all in all, it is still fun. Something that must be mentioned, however, is the final, bonus level. The player must already have 100% completion, but it is completely worth it. Without spoiling anything, just know that it is the best level in the entire game.\n\nStory:\n There isn't much story to the game. There are a few laughs gained with the enemies, but nothing heavy in the story department. There are only 3 cut scenes in the game, so that should be a notice. This doesnt detract too much from the main experience, but it also doesnt help by not having much.\n\nDesign:\n The levels are designed nicely. It isn't anything amazing, but it is still very nice to look at. The enemies, however, are designed very uniquely. My favorite design for the enemies is the design used for the last, normal level, right before Gnasty Gnorc. Insomniac did a good job with the PlayStation hardware.\n\nSound:\nThe music in the game is phenomenal. I love it. It really gets me excited when I play, especially as Im charging with super speed throughout some parts of the game. It is very exhilarating and I love it.\n\nDifficulty:\n The game is rather easy, but not super easy. The secrets are well hidden, but not impossible to figure out. I feel that the difficulty was nicely balanced.\n\nReplay Value:\n One could probably 100% the entire game in less than 10 hours. It is a blast, but still short. There isn't much replay value because of the lack of story, but it is fun while it lasts.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nThis game is RECOMMENDED. It isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it is still a solid game that any platformer fan would enjoy. The camera needs some reworking, the boss battles need something to differentiate them, and the game needs to last. However, it is still great.\nFINAL SCORE= 8.75", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "This is one of my favorite games from the playstation series. When it first came out in 1996, needless to say I was blown away by the 3D directional jumping. It was my first playstation game. Of course there were some issues that I had with the game but it was the first of its kind and it paved the way for improvements. Some reviews have said how the game is hard. I agree to a point. I started playing it when I was in 5th grade and I still have a copy today but at that time it was a new concept to grasp playing a game with 3D controls versus simpler 2D controls from the Nintendo or Sega. But after a while and many Bandicoots being eaten, crushed, boiled in acid, drowning, or falling into dark abysses I came out on top. There are some levels that are still difficult for me (Lights Out for example) but I relish in the challenge it brings.\n\nToo hard for young kids some people say? So was the original Mario Bros from 1985 at one point. Ignoring secret jumping techniques with turtle shells, lives were hard to come by and you definitely needed them for the later worlds. In Crash Bandicoot they practically give lives away because the levels are fairly challenging throughout the game. For example, Boulder Dash wiped out the 50 some lives I had accumulated the first time got to that level.\n\nI agree with other people about the way that you save in that it is kind of annoying but we take that for granted today anyway. In prior games, like Mario 1985, if you got a game over it was back to the beginning of the world you died in. In this game, it's back to the last level you were at before you saved. Maybe the creators were trying to make it a challenging game by doing it that way. In that I say they succeeded.\n\nFor a platform gamer, this game has a nice blend of 3D motion with 2D side scrolling in a colorful environment that was pretty good visually for the graphics at the time. It definitely took you to a different world. The music for the various levels was appropriate and entertaining. Come on, remember Hog Wild? Good times riding that boar! It had a very linear type of progression but it was not too unlike Super Mario World with the coin shaped levels on the overworld map. The bonus rounds were indeed difficult but you could always replay them, minus the saving bonuses once you saved, and never lose lives in the bonus rounds. Aku aku was there in my time of need, especially when toxic barrels were bouncing my way. He is a different but unique take on the power ring or mushroom, flower, star buffs from the other iconic heroes. I am not saying Crash Bandicoot is better than other platform games before him, but he is unique and has his own style that improved in the titles that came after. I give this game a 9 out of 10 or 4.5 stars.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Crash's 1st game (as I reviewed) is my favortie debut game, but his sequel blows me away.  There's one reviewer who says this is an improvement on the original with some sassy style.  They're %100 correct.  The game's best improvements and worst flaws are all I will list, because you already know where I stand if you've read my review on the 1st game (and go check it out if you haven't).\n\nBest Improvement: Saving System.  This allows you to save at anytime, so you're not going to have to get off (becuase your parents said so, of course) without saving all your hard and handy work and having to have to do it all over again.\n\n2nd Best Improvement: You have 5 levels to choose from at anytime.  You don't have to go in order.\n\n3rd Best Improvement: More moves.  Crash is looking good with all his new stunts.\n\n4th Best Improvement: Vehicles.  Crash gets to drive some neato vehicles, including my favorite, the jet pack.\n\n5th Best Improvement: Greater and better bosses, (including N. Gin).\n\n6th Best Improvement: Bigger, Better, and More secret levels.\n\n7th Best: New characters.  I'm lovin' the new addition of characters, including Coco Bandicoot, Crash's sister (whom I think should've been in the 1st game).\n\n8th Best Improvement: It's easier to collect gems, and there's a new addition, crystals.\n\nWorst Flaw: Well, it would be nice if Tawna hadn't suddenly disappeared.  I think she should've been crucial to the entrtie series, not just the 1st game.\n\n2nd Worst Flaw: You can't revisit bosses without a secret code.  You should be able to revisit bosses without having to have to look for secret codes to do so.\n\nSo, those are all the improvements and flaws.  As you can see, better the the 1st game, by far.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I had never played a Crash Bandicoot game before, despite having been a serious gamer for 20+ years.  Therefore, I wanted to play the original to get a sense of what the series is like.  I was expecting an easy, light and breezy adventure, but this game is a serious challenge.  A punishing save system is the main culprit, with very limited chances to save and frequent deaths with a limited number of lives.  However, this is what helps make the game so memorable.  I was on the edge of my seat, completely focused in a zen like state to beat the later levels.\n\nThree worlds with a variety of levels and bosses and a fairly short length ensure you won't get bored.  The game holds up extremely well in 2012, and I had no nostalgia-fueled rose-tinted glasses to view it with.  The platforming is creative and very intense.  Music is fitting, albeit low quality.  Graphics are good.  The only true annoyance is that the camera in some of the forward moving levels can cause some weirdness in jumping and landing on platforms.  Overall, I was shocked at how much fun I had with Crash Bandicoot.  I can't wait to play the sequels!

{"words": "Product arrived far sooner than I had expected, and arrived in great condition, save for a few scratches here and there on the disc.\n\nAside from a little scratch or two, the game plays perfectly, and just as well as I remember it in the good old days. Back when game developers focused on the structure of the game and not just the graphics or any fancy sh** like that. This was back when 90% of the games at the time were all good, simple, and had such great repetitive value. Back when the ruling mascots were Crash, Mario and Sonic. Damn, it just brings tears to my eyes I tell ya.\n\nMy only real nitpick for this product was the case it came in, the jewel case was flimsy, and the tape holding it close was not really necessary, so it broke when I tried opening it. Aside from that, I am satisfied in the long run. I recommend this seller.\n\n[UPDATE][UPDATE][UPDATE]\n\nA little update on the product. The game plays alright up until a certain level very close to the beginning; 'Rolling Stones' to be specific, then it just flat out freezes and sits there. This really doesn't surprise me, these games are almost 20 years old, and it is rare to find a used one in perfect condition. I'll give this one game a little extra time and try multiple times to see if the level will play.\n\nI won't change my opinion about this seller, I am not frustrated, or anything. I got the game in a great time window, it was cheap, and it works at least. Just a little advice to anyone distributing aged games like these; I'd suggest trying to at least play these used games through and make sure they work 90% at least. Time consuming? Maybe, but in the end, the seller gets money, and the customer gets their money's worth and their satisfaction is guaranteed. Fair trade, everyone wins.\n\nI'll give it another week or two of trying it, if I can't get it to play past that point, then I may be returning it.", "label": "bad review"}

Before that, I was hooked on fighting games, like street fighters, and tekken, but they are not that fun after playing it a 100 times or so. In this game you can spend as much time without losing interest.\nIt is, more or less, like the first part. There is aku-aku, boxes to crash, gems (more difficult), new bosses after each floor. And by the by, this game is divided into 5 floors, each floor with 5 doors, each door with a different adventure. You can finish the game, like I did the first time, without collecting gems, but it is not that fun. Hint: If you break all the boxes of one level you are rewarded a gem. There are hidden levels for some gems, you would have to consult the internet for it. Good luck in that.\nIn this part you can save after each level, it is easier in that respect. I find the gems easier to collect than in the first forbidding game. The designs of the adventure is by far better than the firs.\nThe story line is change a little bit. Instead of the \"Pamela Anderson\" of a lover Crash had, he gets a more geeky \"Meg Ryan\" of a sister. Dr Cortex is still missing things up. The assistant from the first part does not appear except when he tries to communicate Crash to warn him from Cortex. You want to know more? Get the gems first.\nThere is also a sixth hidden floor. You would have to reach it by a trick, and again check the net for that.\nThe game was the best I have ever tried. It makes my life harder, since I cannot find better games to play anymore.

{"words": "I remember when I first got this game with a Playstation console in early 1998. It was a great phenomenon then, because the Crash Bandicoot series was able to bring some new life to the platforming genre of gaming with its 2D and 3D interchangeable levels.\n\nCrash must go through 25 levels and 6 bosses in this game, but unlike the later games in the series, Crash must tackle the levels chronologically by progressively going through 3 islands.\n\nWhile the gameplay is fun and interesting, the game has its flaws as well. First off, you can only save when you either complete a bonus round (which can only be access one time in each level) or when you collect a gem for destroying every crate in the level. This gets frustrating, because in order to get each gem, you must complete the level and break the boxes without losing a life, plus the fact that colored gems are required to complete certain levels. If I were you, I wouldn't worry about the box gems just yet and just try to find the bonus in the newer level you are at if you want to call it a day. You may have to do the newer level again, which tends to be a flaw.\n\nDespite this, I highly recommend this for fans of previous platforming games like Donkey Kong Country and Sonic the Hedgehog.

{"words": "I'm semi serious about this. This game is tough. It's an excellent platformer, one of the all time best for that matter, but some of the levels are rage inducing.\n\nCrash is the perfect mascot/icon for Sony and they let him go. At the time when Sony needed one, Crash was there and sold systems. He was the face of Playstation and it's baffling why they didn't hang on to him. Just ask Nintendo or Sega what the advantages of a mascot are. Nintendo is dead without Mario and after many failed attempts, Sega is still trying to resurrect Sonic. Crash was perfect for Sony. He's funny, has attitude, likable and recognizable and the games we're the first, really good 3D platformers for the next generation. He also provided a stable franchise for the younger audience, which every company knows they want and need. What happened here? Man, I remember the commercials when a guy in a Crash outfit went to Nintendo headquarters and stood outside with a bullhorn and was taunting Mario, daring him to come out. Classic. That was Crash. Sony really dropped the ball here.\n\nCrash has never been the same since Naughty Dog let him get away. Other developers have made some very uninspired sequels with him, changing his looks, alliances and even voice. I know you can't do the same thing forever but none have come close to the success of Naughty Dog, when they held the reins of this franchise. Today, Crash sits in a woeful state, being made to participate in very un-Crash-like games.\n\nThis game started it all though. This changed the platformer forever. While Mario and Sonic we're still going left to right in their side scrolling adventures, Crash took us into his world with glorious 3D. It said something about the future of games and consoles at the same time and it was only on Playstation. Even today, this is a very challenging platformer. Amidst the Ratchet's, Jak's, Sly's and 3D Mario's and Sonic's, the original Crash is about as tough as there is. But it's also compelling enough to want to keep going. You never don't know how your going to get through the level (they're linear afterall), it's getting the right timing and touch to do what needs to be done. There are some truly insane levels here that will test all your patience and nerve. But you'll just want to keep trying, at least till you get to your next save point so you know you don't have to do the level again that you just did. Fortunately, there's plenty of fruit and extra lives, but your gonna need them all.\n\nThe audio, video, and play mechanics in the original Crash trilogy are spot on. These games still look, sound and play great today. They're a very few of the only original PSone games I can bare to look at, let alone play anymore. The look is perfect with bright colors and varied enviornments and the music and sounds are catchy and perfect for each stage. These games have aged extremely well and are a real tribute to the developers at Naughty Dog.\n\nThere are a couple of downsides though. These games are really tough, maybe too tough for the average gamer or especially child. Some of this is intentional design and some I feel maybe the fact that 3D platforming was in it's infancy at this time. Some of the angles on jumps, just seem a little off. The perspective can make it really tricky. Another problem is that the save points can be a little far between. Not the check points during the levels, they are plentiful and life saving, but the save points. Sometimes, I just wanted to finish a level I'd been on for a while, save and quit. But then I'd find that I had to go through another whole level and a half, just to get the bonus round/save point. And even the bonus round was tricky sometimes as it's set up as a mini level requiring you to get from one side to the other but if you fell along the way, you'd have to restart the level to get back to it. Again, more challenge and patience testing. My final complaint is that sometimes you'd have a nice number of lives you've accumulated from previous levels, say 20 or so, you save, come back and you only start with 4!!! I want my lives, I earned them!!! On a final note, I downloaded Crash on my PS3 but cant save as it wont, even though PS2 games do, so I have to use passwords. It's a little annoying but if they didn't provide them, then I'd really never be able to save.\n\nFor anyone new to Crash, looking to try it out, don't let any of this put you off. These (the first 3) are fantastic games overall. They're among the tip top in the platforming genre and are some of the most challenging but rewarding at the same time. Crash is truly a gaming icon and I hope some way, somehow, that his original developers can one day give him and us another grand adventure worthy of the name Crash Bandicoot.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Back when the Sony Playstation and Nintendo 64 were first released, people were getting all excited over Super Mario 64 in 1996.  It was new, it was innovative.  It had something.  Meanwhile, the Sony Playstation got Crash Bandicoot, and this was described as a game that could take Mario on at his own game.  That, of course, didn't happen, as Mario still holds the torch.  However, Crash Bandicoot wasn't a bad game.  It was, however, a bit more flawed than most other games out there for certain reasons, the main one seeming to be its unforgiving difficulty.  There were, of course, other mitigating factors.\n\nCrash Bandicoot carries the--even then--overdone save the damsel in distress storyline, ala Mario saving Princess Peach over and over.  Much like Mario, however, Crash wasn't about storyline.  It was about gameplay, and here it's just as simplistic as it is in your average 2D side-scroller.  Crash only has two attacks.  His spinning attack and a jump attack.  You'll use this to take down your enemies.  There are advantages to using one attack over the other.  For example, the spinning attack can potentially send enemies flying into other enemies while the jump attack gives Crash some extra air, which is actually needed to access some of the games little secrets.\n\nThroughout each level, Crash also has the ability to obtain Aki-Aki.  A mask that serves to protect Crash.  If you have one you can sustain two hits before you die.  If you have two you can sustain three hits.  If you have three you'll be temporarily invincible.  The game also makes it a point to give you an Aki-Aki if you're dying too many times in a certain level, and believe me, that'll happen a lot.  The good news is that Crash Bandicoot isn't shy about giving you extra lives.  The bad news is that you'll still mow through a lot of them pretty quickly.  A lot of the times things are just unfair.  The camera is permanently fixed behind Crash, so sometimes it's hard to predict jumps, or sometimes even where some enemies are.  Also, the amount of surprises they throw at you can be annoying as well.  Like a bridge where the planks fall out and then you get to what is seemingly a dead end only to find out that you've no time to look because the plank your standing on is also lose.  Thus, you've no choice but to go through a lot of trial and error in levels.\n\nTo its credit, though, Crash Bandicoot has a variety of levels.  There's the basic 3D platforming where you basically run through the level in a straight line with the camera behind you, but there are some levels that make you go about the old fashioned way by these levels being 2D side-scrollers.  There are also levels where you'll run from a boulder in Indiana Jones style, levels where you'll ride on a hog.  You'll get your fill from these levels.  Although, many level designs are also very simplistic and straightforward.  There's not a whole lot of exploration to be done, and even when you can veer off course, you'll only be backtracking to get back on the right course.  In short, many levels are just too linear.\n\nMastering the game is also fairly difficult.  Throughout each level there are crates that you have to smash.  If you smash all the crates, you score a perfect.  Seems simple right?  Well, the catch is you have to smash every crate in the level without dying.  And again, with some unfair camera angles in some levels, and the trial and error, you'll be attempting to score a perfect on a level several times.  Likewise, it seems strange that the levels are so difficult yet the games bosses are so easily taken down--including the final boss Dr. Neo Cortex.  Most boss battles aren't a challenge, but getting to them sure as hell is.\n\nEven the games save system is flawed.  As you go through each and every level you'll find tokens that'll let you catch a glimpse of the girl Crash is out to save in this game.  The problem is this token is hidden in crates throughout the level.  The second problem is that you need three of them.  The THIRD problem is that you have to go through some stupid mini-level in order for your game to actually be saved.  They're played out in a 2D side-scroller like fashion with the exception that even in these levels there are some 3D elements, which again require trial and error to get through sometimes.  At least you don't lose a life... just the chance to save your game.  The FOURTH problem with this is that once you collect all three tokens, whether you were able to make it through the bonus round and save your game or not, you can't get them again.  Thus in each level you're only given the chance to save once, and you may not even get it!  This is inexcusable.  The later installments of the series certainly did a better job with the save feature.  There's also a password system here for those who don't have a memory card, and that's really nice to have.  Again, however, it sucks that you only really get one chance to save.  You can save after scoring a perfect on a level, but again, that's a one time deal.  You can't go to an easy level, score a perfect and save again.\n\nDespite its gameplay issues, Crash Bandicoot looked good at least.  Especially for a game released in 1996.  It runs fairly smoothly, and just looks great for the time of its release.  It wasn't a launch title, but at least it was a game that was easy on the eyes.  The levels also look good and even too this day the game still has a particular visual charm to it.  It can't hold a candle up to today's graphics but in 1996 this was a charmer.  The game also didn't sound so bad either.  Some tunes do get annoying, but a lot of tunes really satisfy the levels, and the sound effects are brilliant.  As far as presentation goes, Crash Bandicoot really knew how to hand it to us.\n\nUnfortunately, it's unforgiving difficulty may actually be enough to turn some fans away after a while.  Was it a good game?  Sure it was.  But the first installment just had a lot of unforgiving issues that thankfully were worked out in the second game.  It's not bad for a first outing, but a game shouldn't be so unforgiving in its difficulty.\n\nPros:\n\n+It's a good looking game\n\n+It sounds good\n\n+Simple gameplay that anyone can pick up and learn\n\n+A variety of levels\n\n+Tons of secrets and little things to do; you'll be busy just trying to complete the game 100%\n\nCons:\n\n-The difficulty level of this game is unforgiving\n\n-Bad camera angles\n\n-The games levels are difficult yet the games bosses are disturbingly easy\n\n-A lot of trial and error moments\n\n-Many levels are too linear\n\n-The save system set up is absolutely horrible\n\nIt's still a good game, but later games in the series do a far better job.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "Wasn't the very first Crash Bandicoot game supposed to become one of the all-time greatest Playstation games?  That's what Sony thought would happen back in the day.  After all, they promoted the game to death.  Well look at that... didn't happen!  And with good reason.  The game is horrible.  I can't believe ANYONE would prefer this junk over Sonic the Hedgehog or, especially, the Mario Bros. series.\n\nYou have to give Sony a LOT of credit for all the attention they put into Crash Bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as Mario and Sonic, but gamers never really caught on to Crash the same way.  When you think about it, the Playstation already HAD a huge selection of games to choose from around the time Crash was released, therefore Sony didn't even NEED a mascot.  People were buying Playstation games like crazy anyway!  Crash Bandicoot never even had to exist.\n\nYou'd think for a debut game (a BIG debut, considering all the advertisements on TV commercials) Sony would have made the game a *little* easier for younger or inexperienced gamers to play.  Instead, Sony started off the Crash series with impossible bonus levels (impossible to complete AND find- I didn't even KNOW the game had bonus levels until I looked it up in the instruction booklet!)\n\nEven if you ignore the bonus levels, the challenge overall is pretty high anyway thanks to all the difficult stages (such as the one where you're crossing a bridge way up in the sky and continue falling through the wooden cracks- a NIGHTMARE of a level!)  All the lives you earned up to this point in the game will go away.  A mascot debut game shouldn't have the difficulty THIS high because the idea is for players of ALL ages to enjoy the game.  Children will not like the nonstop frustration.\n\nI think the biggest reason Crash Bandicoot isn't remembered today the same way Mario and Sonic's debut games are is because Crash is basically just a blend of Mario and Sonic, but featured in a 3D world.  Think about it.  Crash collects berries throughout the game (Mario collects coins, Sonic collects rings).  Crash has a spin attack (Mario and Sonic already had spin attacks YEARS before Crash's existence).  Sony just didn't have enough creative ideas to come up with something entirely different, and that's why most gamers tend to ignore Crash Bandicoot.  When you already have the best (Mario and Sonic) you don't need imitations.\n\nCrash Bandicoot may have improved later on (not enough of an improvement to earn its mascot reputation, however) but the series certainly did NOT start with a bang.  I will always remember the very first Crash Bandicoot game as being this uninteresting, frustrating experience.  Heck, just the fact that only 62 reviewers have submitted reviews for the game right here on amazon goes to show Crash Bandicoot's first adventure was meant to be gone and forgotten.  Add to the fact that right now in the year 2006 NO ONE is talking about ANY Crash Bandicoot game anymore.  This means you can ignore Crash Bandicoot entirely, and not really miss out on anything.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Crash Bandicoot's my favorite video game character and all his work is genius.  I'm looking forward to his latest video game installment, Crash Tag Team Racing.  The game's graphics are good, the gameplay itself sounds amuzing, and the trailer (on GameSpot) prove how visually stunning it's going to be too.  But, Crash's humble beginning is not the same as Mario and Sonic's were.  It was much better, more creative, and bigger.\n\nMario's was just an arcade game.  It was hard, but it didn't take to long to master it, and I don't even know if there was a boss.  Sonic's debut was better then Mario's.  A game you could play without spending money, good levels, challenging, better bosses, and a special ending you could view if you collected all the items necessary.  But, these debuts lacked what Crash's had.  Most challenging, best bosses, better secret ending, and most of all, a 3-D world to play in.\n\nCrash's world is not fully 3-D in this game (in fact up till Crash Twinsanity, none of them have been), but it is very good as far as it goes.  The VIRTUAL world looks like the REAL world.  That's one of the game's strongest points.  The controls are very solid and Crash responds amazingly well to your commands.  This spoiled me.  I'd play a Crash game and then go play something else with looser controls and be upset by the lack of response.  I became versatile after a while though.  Crash lacks moves in this game, but he has more then Sonic and/or Mario had in their debut games.  Crash has 3, Mario and Soinc only had 1.  Crash's moves are running, jumping, and spinning.  The spinnig move is an extremely creative thing.  To make up for Sonic's spin, Naughty Dog brought out the bigger and better guns.  Crash's spin is much easier to control and is much more effective.  It also doesn't threaten you in a strange, almost indescribable way.  Sonic's spin reqired that you dash in the direction that you were facing before you started spinning.  Sega called this the spin dash.  This could throw you to your death.  Not Crash's.  Crash could move or stay still when spinning.  Note: Soinc didn't have the spin dash in his debut game.  Mario and Sonic's jumping, I'll admit, was better.  They were tighter then Crash.  Their direction could be changed much, much easier then Crash when jumping.  Crash jumps higher though.  Crash runs kind of slow, especially when you need to get something done. But he's slower in Crash Twinsanity.  Crash's camera control is hardly ever a problem.  Every once in a while you'll have to strain your eye a little, but it's still a better camera then Soinc's.  Mario's is best out of all, though, 'cause you could see the entire level all at once.\n\nAs for the other features of the game, they're pretty outstanding.  The levels are big and challenging.  There's also secret levels in Crash.  I've never seen anything like that in Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, have you?  No, I didn't think so.  Crash's biggest flaw is the saving system.  In the game, you must collect 3 tokens of Crash's girfriend's head (hidden in the level) to get to a bonus area.  You must get to the end of the Tawna (Crash's girlfriend's name is Tawna) Bonus Round, touch Tawna (who's just standing there), and then exit the Tawna Bonus Round via a warp pad in order to save.  If you don't do exactly what I said had to be done in order to save, you don't get to save. Not fair at all.  But, it's still better then Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, 'cause you can't save at all in those games.  There are also two other kinds of bonus rounds in the game, The Cortex (main bad guy of the game) Bonus Rounds and the Brio (Cortex's right-hand man) Bonus Rounds.  You can't save in these bonus rounds, even if you get to the end of them without falling off the platforms.  Oh and get this, there aren't Tawna Bonus Rounds in all the levels, so you don't have a chance to save if your parents tell you to get off and you're in a level like Hog Wild where there's no bonus rounds.  Big flaw.  The 2nd biggest flaw is the way you have to collect gems.  In the game you must collect 32 (I think; don't quote me on that number, because I'm not sure) gems in order to see the secret ending.  However, it's a little too hard to collect them all.  I understand most people think the game's not hard enough, but I think it's a little too hard.  To collect a gem, you must destroy every single crate in a level and get to the end without losing a life.  I'm all for destroying every crate, but I think you should be able to lose a life and still get the gem.  It should only matter if you destroy all the boxes.\n\nSo, if you're wanting to compare Mario and Sonic to Crash, I'd say Crash all the way.  And, as you can see, if you're reading this, Crash's 1st game was much better then Mario and Sonic's.  I say Crash is best, no matter what anyone else tells me.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Alright, so I just used naughty for the play on the company name, but it got your attention, aparently, so...\n\nThis is the oldest Naughty Dog title I've played (as far as I know), however it has a lot of the issues which I've noticed from their games in the past.  Nasty difficulty spikes (the eight or so level should be closer to the end) and the 'one path to the end of a platformer' standard which Super Mario World truely broke when it came out take the one star out of this otherwise superb game.\n\nWhile the graphics are fantastic for PS1, and moderate at worst for PS2, sometimes I find it hard to tell where, exactly, Crash is going to land.  Also this very much 3D platformer has 'side scrolling' sections where I become convinced that pressing down will make crash duck, not fall into a bottomless pit, water, or whatever else is in the foreground.  Saving can sometimes prove difficult, although, if you look in the right places, you can find a way to save after every significant area.  Also, often after completing certain difficult areas, you'll be able to do them again at any point you desire, good for getting the games bonuses.\n\nI haven't finished the game yet (I'm only half way through), so anything in this review could change, although it's unlikely.  Most Naughty Dog games are consistantly good or bad in every way.\n\nAnyway, the bonuses are usually earned by getting through a level opening EVERY box in the level without losing a single life.  Others are given through bonus levels, etc.\n\nA very great game for a great price.", "label": "good review"}

An expert can beat the game in about five hours, but doing so relies on much more than just simple skill, like most modern games. Even though the second & third entries were great (and, honestly, longer), I kind of regretted that they didn't take as much of an advantage of their environments as the first did.

{"words": "I tried the Crash 2 PlayStation game about 1998 and it was delightful. It was, in fact, so delightful that I looked around for the first part to start from the proper point.\nWhen I started playing the first part, I was disappointed by the difference of the story, but, still, It was a nice game.\nThe graphics are excellent. The story is original. It speaks about a genetically engineered dog, named Crash, that resembles human beings. This genetic procedure was done by Dr Cortex (or more precisely by his degraded assistant). Then Dr Cortex goes on the produce a new female version of this Crash. Of course crash falls in love with her. Dr Cortex, being a wicked soul, parts between the two and then Crash needs to go through so many obstacles to reach his lover.\nSo many levels are divided into islands, and each set of levels is followed by a bad boss. Some are hard and some are easy. It depends in your skill in such games. The story is concluded by a battle between this Crash and Dr Cortex. If you win then you got it.\nAnd to complicate life even more, the designers introduced the concept of gaining gems. If you get all the gems you can continue the game in a new fashion. I aint saying it 'cause I don't want to spoil things for you. To attain these gems is a difficult task. As for me, I got them but after being kicked in the teeth for it. You should not even dream of getting the gems in order of levels. No, mon ami, some times you have to go to a certain advanced level to get a \"green gem,\" for instance, to get the gem in the, say, fourth level. You would have to check the net for the tricks, dirty if I may, and the hidden places. Good luck in that.\nThere is \"aku-aku,\" which is a mask that is considered as an extra life if you get touched by any of the enemies. Take 3 aku-akus and you become invincible for some seconds and you kill any of the enemies by a mere touch.\nOf course, there are saving stations. You do not get to save after every level. This is a drawback. Saving stations are also level you have to jump, crush, step on dynamite, and so on. If you fall down, you cannot save, you have to go to the next saving station. It is hare, I am telling you.\nThe game is great, and if you win with a 100 per-cent then you are the man!\nCrash 2 (5 Stars):\nThe Best Game Ever:\nThis game has everything the first part lacked. It has even better graphics. This was the first one of the crash series I tried, and it was fun. Before that, I was hooked on fighting games, like street fighters, and tekken, but they are not that fun after playing it a 100 times or so. In this game you can spend as much time without losing interest.\nIt is, more or less, like the first part. There is aku-aku, boxes to crash, gems (more difficult), new bosses after each floor. And by the by, this game is divided into 5 floors, each floor with 5 doors, each door with a different adventure. You can finish the game, like I did the first time, without collecting gems, but it is not that fun. Hint: If you break all the boxes of one level you are rewarded a gem. There are hidden levels for some gems, you would have to consult the internet for it. Good luck in that.\nIn this part you can save after each level, it is easier in that respect. I find the gems easier to collect than in the first forbidding game. The designs of the adventure is by far better than the firs.\nThe story line is change a little bit. Instead of the \"Pamela Anderson\" of a lover Crash had, he gets a more geeky \"Meg Ryan\" of a sister. Dr Cortex is still missing things up. The assistant from the first part does not appear except when he tries to communicate Crash to warn him from Cortex. You want to know more? Get the gems first.\nThere is also a sixth hidden floor. You would have to reach it by a trick, and again check the net for that.\nThe game was the best I have ever tried. It makes my life harder, since I cannot find better games to play anymore. It will make you look for other adventures of Crash.", "label": "good review"}

The controls took a little bit of getting used to but the gameplay overall was responsive and fun.

It is in the same spirit of the Mario 64 game but not as polished or well refined.  The camera angles do make it hard to maneuver Croc in some parts of the game which add to the challenge.

{"words": "Naughty Dog and Sony released Crash Bandicoot, which rivaled the likes of Mario and Sonic. In the end, many gamers liked Crash's non-stop action, but others simply just skipped it. Even though it was very promising, Crash's gameplay did not really offer anything new, which featured elements you can find in a 16-bit platformer.\n\nYou play as Crash, whose girlfriend is kidnapped by Dr. Neo Cortex. You basically just run through the levels from start to finish and fight bosses after each world. Even though the action is intense throughout, the gameplay becomes really tedious. Crash Bandicoot did nothing new for adventure games and it isn't really 3D since you're restricted to one path. All you do is make your way through levels, dodging obstacles, avoiding enemies, and collect items and nothing more. The difficulty level is not exactly high either, and the challenge is severely lacking.\n\nCrash's graphics are quite impressive for a PlayStation game, including well-textured environments and colorful characters. Effects like running water and mist and fog are great eye-candy. The visuals are the game's only saving grace. Controlling the bandicoot can be a hassle since it doesn't use analog. You're forced to deal with sensitivity of the crosspad and at times will result in unwanted deaths.\n\nAside from good graphics, you're left with nothing but an average platformer equivalent to that of a 16-bit Sonic game in a polygonal world. While it may be 3D, Crash plays out too much like an old side-scrolling game of the past.

It is actually a very smart game that teaches you how to play in the first level without a single word of dialog or a single segment of text.\n\nMy four year old cousin can pick this up and play it easily thanks to the intuitive design. The music is fun. The controls are smooth. And the game is just simply fun.\n\nThere is little completion bonus with only challenge maps and an extra boss as a reward. But the levels are fun an memorable. The volcanic levels, snow levels, desert levels, and castle levels are extremely fun and exciting.\n\nGet this for young gamers or people who like playing platformer games.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I really, really wanted to like this game, I loved the cover, and I loved the characters, and the personality of the protagonist, but the controls are not very good at all. When you push the analog stick back, the character just turns around and moves all over the place, and jumping on platforms is painful to say the least. I would have liked this game if the controls were not so finicky, but it did extremely poorly in that department. If the controls were bearable, I would have actually enjoyed the game.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "Whatever happened to the days when games were made to be fun?  Whatever happened to the days where replay value was through the roof and graphics were not as heavily emphasized? This game is well over 10 years old now and it is still fun to play.  Even in this day and age I see kids enjoying it.  This should be one of those games that developers look back upon and say what made that game so much fun?  What can we learn from this aside from improving upon the old school 3D graphics?  Spyro may not be the best game of all time but it certainly is a fun one for me that I have had a lot of fond memories playing.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I was feeling nostalgic so I bought this game along with a few others to relive my childhood. It's as much fun as I remember! There's always plenty to do, from finishing levels to completing timed flight races. Even if you beat the final boss in the game, you can keep playing to collect all the gems and find all the dragons. Once you do that, you get to open up new content!

{"words": "Croc is one of those games I only had a small chance encounter with when I was younger. The demo disc that came with my PlayStation back in 1997 had a demo of the game and by all accounts I was pretty taken with. The graphics were bright and colorful, the world it presented (and by extension Croc and the Gobbos) were cute and likable and overall it seemed to be a pretty solid 3D platformer. Developed by Argonaut Software who developed the Super FX technology used in Nintendo's Star Fox on the SNES in the early 1990's, I ordered a copy of the game based on those memories... but fifteen years is a long time to be away from any game and with advancements in gaming this leaves little room for error. Unfortunately, if the title of this review is any indication, Croc pretty much squanders most of the good will its positives bring to the table and only serves as a history lesson as to why the series never saw daylight after the 32-bit generation.\n\nAlmost all of Croc's problems center on the controls. Well, it's not completely on the controls, rather it's a combination of the controls AND a camera that does whatever it wants - but if it wasn't for this I firmly believe more people would remember it. The game's controls are not unlike those in Core Design/Edios' Tomb Raider series - which in today's world some people find rather archaic - but I'm still at home with them since I grew up with that game. What makes Croc different (and ultimately more problematic) is the camera is not completely locked behind Croc at every moment. This makes certain moments of the game painful to play and its because these controls are more befitting of a game like Tomb Raider where the game world is more technical being built on a grid of squares. This isn't the case with Croc.\n\nWell, that's kind of a lie because the further you get in the Legend of Gobbos the more technical (and challenging) the levels are with all their little platforms and obstacles where the clunky controls become a real liability. Even worse are the controls when Croc is underwater or doing a mini-game as these sections are simply horrendous. The situation with the controls is a real shame since the game (aside from the utterly pathetic boss battles) would still be astounding today if it wasn't for them. It's (kind) of possible to enjoy Croc despite its problems but I personally had to play the game in small bite-sized portions to really avoid my building frustrations - a red flag for a gamer if there ever was one.\n\nDespite Croc's shortcomings I can't really tell people to flat-out avoid the game. I still have a soft spot for it (and the characters) despite what I experienced while playing through it. Still, if you can I'd recommend trying - or revisting - the game before you buy it. For those that played Croc when it originally came out nostalgia might be enough to save it, but those without an attachment to the IP will quickly see the game as the ailing entity it is.", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "I played Croc 2 more often, but I did play Croc: Legend of the Gobbos when I was young.  These games were so fun, as well as difficult (I never managed to get 100% completion on either of them).  The controls are a bit stiff, but this did release in 1997, so that should be expected.  The game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple, but the game is fun nonetheless, and for me it's a pretty timeless classic, that I am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games.

Spyro was a very important part of my childhood happiness, and remains a part of my life to this day. In a time where all the other young girls around me were playing with kitchen sets and drawing on the sidewalk with chalk, I was kicking Gnorc butt.\n\nAs I'm sure there are some people out there who are still unfamiliar with everyone's favorite purple dragon, how about a quick rundown?\n\nThe Dragon Realms are a peaceful place, full of artists and dreamers and crafters, and they pride themselves on their beautiful gems. While some dragons are being interviewed about their world, the long banished Gnasty Gnorc overhears some less than positive comments about himself. In retaliation, he turns all of the dragon's beautiful gems (which reflect his face back at him) into Gnorc minions, and freezes the dragons in crystal prisons. All, that is, except one short little purple firebreather, who becomes the hero by taking it upon himself to defeat the Gnorcs and free all the dragons.\n\nYou utilize two attacks; your flame breath, and your horn charge. Throughout the levels you encounter several types of enemies, but especially Gnorcs. Your goal throughout the game is to unfreeze all the dragons, and collect stolen dragon eggs from the taunting blue thieves. Each of the six homeworlds contains a non-mandatory boss battle (aside from the Gnorc Gnexus) and a balloonist who will transport you to the next homeworld. Your health meter is represented by a little dragonfly by the name of Sparx that follows you around. Sparx starts out bright yellow, dulls to blue, then to green, and once he is gone, you're toast. Lives are gained with small dragon statues, or collecting so many of a small silver orb dropped by previously defeated enemies.\n\nSpyro is a classic that will never die, and your life will only be made better by playing it!", "label": "good review"}

It was like New and I love that.\n  Okay, now I have been an enormous fan of Spyro for years since my childhood.

The game play is fluent and fun, The visuals for its time is still vibrant with color, the enemies are well varied, and it's a pleasure to experience from start to finish.

I did everything in the game for 120% in a matter of days, as I found it to be very addicting.\n\nThe gameplay consists of exploring a few hub worlds which are connected to various levels where you must free dragons, collect diamonds and defeat the bad guys.  Some levels include full flight, which adds some much needed variety to the core gameplay.  The boss battles were the weakest part, as they didn't really stand out and were pretty tame.  Games nowadays are so complex that it was a pleasure to play something so simple.  Running around colorful worlds, collecting multi-colored diamonds and discovering secret areas are always a good time, and Spyro is the purest form of these ideas.\n\nThe simplicity of the gameplay combined with the variety in worlds/levels ensured it never got boring.

{"words": "Croc, original released in 1997 had the same appeal that Crash Bandicoot had.  It was a simplistic game that was absolutely gorgeous to look at.  Obviously inspired by Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario 64, Croc was a game that could've been for everyone.  However, lackluster controls and a bad camera make Croc more frustrating than fun.\n\nAs with most games aimed at the younger audience, Croc has a simple story.  The Gobbos have been kidnapped by an evil Baron.  It's up to Croc to save the Gobbos and stop the Baron.  And he'll traverse four worlds to do it.\n\nThe level layout of Croc is surprisingly good.  Levels are pretty straightforward but you'll be able to veer off path whenever you need to.  In every level your goal is to get to the end and ring the gong.  Along the way Croc will be faced with enemies and natural traps like lava or freezing waters.  In every level you'll also collect gems.  From level to level the total gems you finish with stack up on each other.  For every 100 gems you'll get an extra life, and you'll need those lives.  There are also six Gobbos in every level you venture to.  Five of them are scattered throughout the level randomly.  However, the last Gobbo requires you to find five special gems and open a special door at the end of a level.  Upon finding those gems and opening a special door, the game will usually make you play some kind of bonus game or solve a puzzle to get the last Gobbo.  Some of these parts of the game are incredibly frustrating.  For example, in one bonus game you'll have to make Croc jump on buttons in order to \"whack\" sheep in a sort of Whack the Mole fashion.  However, it speeds up and the controls aren't all that friendly.\n\nThat may very well be the biggest problem with Croc.  The game is such a pain to control.  You'll suffer a lot for this.  Up always moves Croc forward but the camera is always moving.  Croc doesn't turn sharp enough so you'll mostly spend time stopping and turning so that you can continue on your way.  This wouldn't be so bad if there weren't enemies on your tail or if you didn't have to stop and turn on a collapsing platform.  Even worse is the camera.  You don't get control over it at all.  The view doesn't shift fast enough which may lead to you running into an enemy simply because you don't know where it is, or having to quickly jump off a collapsing platform.  These issues make Croc--an already challenging game as it is--harder than it has to be.  It's frustrating as well.  The game has potential, and the right gameplay elements, but the controls make it too hard.  However, it is still a good challenge.  Completing the game 100% by finding all the Gobbos and getting the second ending is a task in and of itself.\n\nWhat Croc lacks in gameplay it certainly makes up for in everything else.  The game looks stunning.  Especially for a Playstation game in 1997.  The FMVs look incredible, the bosses look spectacular.  The environments look incredible as well.  There are hardly any Playstation games that look this smooth or run this well.  The soundtrack is also a beautiful soundtrack.  In terms of production values, Croc is an astonishing game to behold.\n\nIn short, Croc is a good game, but a game that would've been so much better if it didn't suffer from such horrible controls and a bad camera.  It's a fun game, but only barely so.  There will be many gamers who won't be able to let those issues slide.", "label": "bad review"}

There is only one egg that still is a challenge for me to get and I don't remember the name of the sub-world it is in but it's the one with a whole bunch of trees.  I always forget where to turn/jump to get the height and speed I need to reach the egg.

The mini-games are fun and even though you don't have to complete them to finish the game there is a part of me that always has to complete the game 100%.

{"words": "Spyro the Dragon: the game that SHOULD have been Sony's mascot instead of Crash Bandicoot.\n\nThe original Spyro the Dragon is probably the best platform/adventure game you can find for the Playstation.  I can't give Spyro's first adventure a 5-star rating, though.  Let's get the problems out of the way before moving on to the positive things about Spyro (and believe me, there's a LOT of good things about this game).\n\nPeople have compared Spyro the Dragon to everything from Crash Bandicoot to Banjo-Kazooie to Nights, and... who knows what else.  Well, I think the first Spyro game is JUST as good as all those games.  In fact, Spyro the Dragon is better than the first Crash Bandicoot game.  Now THERE'S a game that disappointed me.  Spyro came out of nowhere and RULED right from the beginning.  I never would have guessed back in 1998 that Spyro would have went on to become a classic.\n\nSpyro's debut does have a few problems, though.  Seeing as how this is Spyro's very first adventure I won't be TOO harsh.  Am I the only one who thinks the play control could have been better?  It's not that I have a tough time controlling Spyro.  Well, to be honest, I DID have trouble controlling him at first.  Spyro doesn't QUITE take off when you hit up, down, left or right on the directional pad.  There's a split second delay before moving forward.  Maybe the creators of the game thought this was part of the realism since, after all, you're moving a DRAGON.  A BIG creature like a dragon won't move forward right away.  Then again, Spyro is small compared to the dragons you have to rescue.\n\nControlling Spyro was definitely a problem for me at first.  For example, attempting to properly jump on top of the three round platforms you encounter at the very beginning of the first world was NOT an easy task.  I kept sliding off.  By the way, I recommend you take advantage of these round platforms to get to know the controller.  Master the controller before exploring the world.  This will cut down on any possible frustration you may encounter in the future.\n\nI have to consider that my inability to control Spyro may have been due to the camera angles.  Even though the camera in this game is *drastically* better than many other games, you have to admit it isn't flawless either.  If you hit Pause and go to the options, you will see an option for a second camera view called \"active\".  This view is better because the camera immediately follows behind Spyro at ALL times.  The other (default) camera view is more of a hassle trying to figure out where you're moving, and you can't get a good view of what lies ahead.  You may want to change it to \"active\" if the other camera view is difficult for you.  Thank goodness for this option!\n\nSome people have a problem with the lack of challenge.  While it's completely true you won't have much trouble making it to the end of any stage in the game, prepare to die 4 or 5 times in each stage before you understand exactly what you have to do, and where you have to jump.  I think the most challenging thing about Spyro the Dragon are the times you have to jump onto a far-away platform, and many times you just BARELY make it.  Many times you will fall to your death.  Be patient, though.  The game NEVER messes with you by throwing in any impossible jumps.  Sometimes it's about finding *just* the right spot to jump and glide, and if you're off just a *little bit* you won't make it.  The creators of Spyro are smart not to make the game frustrating, seeing as how it's supposed to be a game for the entire family.  Good work.\n\nThe biggest challenge comes at the very end of the game when you face the main boss.  He's really easy to beat, however, GETTING to him is a whole other story.  You see, right at the very end before you face him, you have to jump over a series of disappearing platforms and if you fall (and you WILL fall the first few times because it's hard) you will land in burning lava and have to do the whole stage over again.  Not that the stage is really that long anyway, but this is by FAR the hardest part of the game.  The other 99% of the game only offers a slight challenge here and there.\n\nWith that said, don't be fooled into thinking the game will be a cakewalk because of all the easy obstacles found throughout World One.  It DOES get harder.  You see, many of the enemies you face in the later levels can only be defeated by either smacking them with your head, or shooting fire at them.  You won't know which of these tricks will be most effective on them until you face the enemy and experiment.  You also have to dodge fireballs, sword-swipes, dogs jumping at you, and tons of other enemy attacks WHILE you try to find the best way to defeat them.  So it's not pathetically easy after all.\n\nA minor complaint is that sometimes while you're walking or running, the path will suddenly end, and you'll fall to your death.  Doesn't happen often, but I thought it would be worth mentioning.\n\nI hate the way Spyro talks.  He sounds like a bratty teenage rebel with a nasally voice.  Not exactly what a dragons voice should sound like.  Also, when you rescue the dragons, sometimes they say important things you might want to pay attention to.  The problem here is that many times the important tips they say aren't really helpful because they say them right AFTER you've already had to do them!  For instance, in one case after you glide to a far-away platform and rescue a dragon, the dragon will tell you how to glide.  Obviously, since I needed to glide in order to rescue him, I already KNOW how to glide!  So I didn't NEED his help!  This happens a few times during the game.  You just want to scream \"Thanks for nothing, bonehead!\"\n\nThe music was done by a member of the rock band the Police, Stewart Copeland.  People may not realize it, but certain themes in Spyro the Dragon are *very* close to some of the songs that made the Police such a legendary rock band.  Stewart Copeland may have intentionally created the music in this game to match that of the Police, specifically the songs \"walking on the moon\" and \"message in a bottle\".  You'll soon realize that the same guy who created the music in this game also played a big part in creating those Police songs.  The music in Spyro the Dragon is also very catchy and appropriate for the level you're in.  No complaints.  The music is fantastic.\n\nI think the creators made a mistake.  When you hit L2 the camera rotates clockwise, and R2 makes the camera rotate counter-clockwise.  It should be the other way around.  Another thing that needs reversed: the way Spyro flies in the bonus stages.  When you press up, you fly down.  When you press down, you fly up!  Strange mistake.  This makes it harder to complete the flying stages, however, you don't have to finish them.\n\nIn fact, despite what people may tell you, you do *not* have to collect ALL the gems and ALL the dragons.  Finding and collecting all the gems and dragons will only give you a better percentage and open up a bonus stage at the end of the game.  The gameplay in Spyro the Dragon can actually be compared to Yoshi's Island- you don't have to find everything, but doing so will open up rewards and give you an overall better score.  The creators did a fantastic job hiding gems and dragons, increasing the challenge.  More often than not you will see a treasure chest or a dragon statue up high on a platform and not have a single clue how to reach it.  It's fun to run around and think about how to reach it.  Some of them are cleverly located.  One word to describe it- *awesome*\n\nAnyway, Spyro the Dragon is tons of fun and may possibly remind you of a 3D Donkey Kong Country, what with TNT barrels and the jungle levels you encounter later on.  Spyro is much better than that overrated Crash Bandicoot game, and you should pick up Spyro the Dragon today.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I have recently come across this wonderful little game that is just absolutely perfect for darklings, seemingly tailor-made.\n\n First of all, the flow of the 3D graphics are quite realistic. The character is an adorable baby dragon, with all the mannerisms of what a baby dragon might be, as if the creators modeled him from puppies & kittens, which is probably what they did.\n\n So little Spyro is set to explore in his homeland, where he derives sustainance from sheep, & questing for gems & treasures, perusing into archways & temples, & fending off sheepherders armed with staves. The Satanic implications are obvious. A dragon insinerating sheep for food...? Sheepherders protecting their sheep? Predator vs. prey...\n\n In certain situations, such as when killing a charging ram, smashing into walls, giants attacking, you will note the joystick vibrate, thereby making the gaming experience a bit more tactile.\n\n So the player is Spyro the Dragon, helped along with the advice of ancestors. It is remarkable how noble these mentors are, their voices echoing their arcane wisdom unto their young.\n\n In travelling, we also embark into Stone Creek, & the more aesthetically-pleasing Dark Hollow, where new creatures wander to be defeated, & more treasures to be plundered. Bit by bit, little Spyro learns to glide, then eventually fly.\n\nGaming tip: Avoid water!", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "The is the first Spyro game and it paved the road for all the other Spyro games. The story: When the evil Nasty Norc turns all of the dragons into statues, it's up to Spyro, a small purple dragon, to set them free and defeat Nasty Norc. You travel with Sparx, your dragonfly companion and also your health gage, as you collect gems and go through six gigantic worlds with over 25 levels in all. This game is great, although it's not very challenging, it offers hour of entertainment. My favorite world is the Beast Makers world. It's a creepy place and almost all the levels in it take place at nighttime, which to me is the best type of level in Spyro. My favorite is Tree Tops because it is a gigantic level that gives you that creepy feeling, even the music is creepy in it's own way. Another minor flaw in this game is that it has no mini-games in it. Those always provide extracurricular fun, but I'm happy to say that they are introduced in a later Spyro release. I'd recommend this game today if you don't already have it. If you not into Spyro, this is the place to start at.", "label": "good review"}

Thieves have stolen a bunch of dragon eggs and you have to chase them down and get the eggs back, but this is MUCH easier said than done.  I have spent hours chasing these guys on some levels.

{"words": "Do not be fooled by the fact that dragons are more suited to little kids and that the game appears like a cartoon. This is a very fun game in which an evil creature called Gnasty Gnorc scatters gems all over the dragon world, turns some into his minions, lets blue thieves into the dragon world to steal their precious dragon eggs, and encases all the dragons in crystal. He missed Spyro, so it's his job to turn the dragon world the way it was. The graphics are colorful and the sound and music are also nice, and as for replay value, it has a fairly good amount. If there is one thing to complain about, it is the difficulty level. The enemies don't put up too much of a threat, and finding gems and dragons is usually fairly easy, and even the bosses are pretty easy to toast. But it can prove quite a challenge to some people, and may include some testing with some things. But besides these two facts, Spyro the Dragon is a nice, colorful game that is well worth the money.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "I own all the Spyro games that Play Station has ever made. I would have to say that this game has advanges and disadvanges.

( Sorry, but I won't give the funny parts away. )\nThe disadvanges is that you can't swim. In the other to games you can but in this game, if you touch the water you will die!!\nAnother bad thing is that they don't have the cute characters like the other two games. I would buy Spyro 3 first and then buy Spyro 1. I think Spyro 3 has more stuff to do and has a better story line. I even think Spyro has a better voice.

Sure, some parts of this game is a little frustrating, and sure, the camera angles are a bit awkward, but you get used to it and get the hang of it. It's a lot like RP games, where the first time you play it, it is incredibly hard, but once you beat it, you'll play it hundreds of times.  I must have beat this game atleast thirty times.

{"words": "This game is a very fun game.  Very well made.  You play Spyro(DUH), a young dragon.  All the other dragons(I think there are 60 or so of them),  have been captured and turned to stone,  and are scattered about in the different worlds.  The Dragon Eggs have been stolen by theives who are running around and hiding in different worlds.  The dragon's treasure is lying around everywhere(not to mention alot of it has been turned into enemies).  And who is the cause of this?  GNASTY GNORC.  And now, as Spyro, you must save the dragons,  find the eggs, collect the treasure and defeat Gnasty Gnorc.  Ok,  that's the plot basicall; now here is what the game is like:  As Spyro, your mission is to(As I said before) save the dragons, find the tresure and rescue the eggs.  Being a young dragon,  your wings are not fully grown,  so you can not fly.  You can, however, glide over short distances.  You also have the ability to(Of course)breathe fire and charge with your horns.  There are several worlds throughout the game.  Each of these worlds has one home level, and in each of the home levels, there are doorway/portholes through which lie other levels for the worlds.  In each of the worlds there will be dragons, treasure and eggs.\nDragons:  These have been turned to stone by Gnasty Gnorc.  To save them you simply find them, then walk up to them or charge at them or Flame them.  They will then come back to life and talk to you before flying away.  Some will give you advice,  others will thank you, and some will just talk (sometimes insulting you).\nTreasure:  Treusure is just lying around in different places.  Most of the enemies turn into treasure(which looks like gem stones).  Some treasure are in chests.  Most chests can be rammed or flamed to open them, but some requre dynamite or fire works or other ways to open them.\nEggs: These are held by theives.  To get them,  you must chase after the theif and ram or flame him.\nEnemies: There is a large variety of enemies (most enemies are really treasure that have been turned into minions for Gnasty Gnorc).  Most can be killed by ramming or flaming,  though some are armored and can only be hurt by flaming and not by ramming or visa versa.  Some boss enemies, however, require special battle tactics.\n  There are also fairies who will help you in some way.  Some will catch you if your falling, and will move you to safety,  while others will give you a Super Strong fire breath(which will allow you to flame armored enemies).  Hovering above Spyro is a dragonfly.  The color of the dragon fly shows you your current health. Green, if your have full health, and red if you are very hurt.  He will disappear if you get hurt when he is red.  In each home world there are guys with hot air ballons.  These ballooners tell you what you must do in that world for them to take you to the next world (you can always return to past worlds later to pck up anything you might have missed).  In most worlds you usually have to find a certain number of dragons, treasure or eggs.  Finally, you will get to Gnasty's world, where you will have to fight Gnasty Gnorc.\n  Well, that's \"Spyro the Dragon\".  I recommend this game to anyone who has Playstation.  It's not a waste of money,  I assure you.", "label": "good review"}

But it looks great and is still entertaining so it's worth the money.\nOverall: 9/10 - This blew me away with its creativity and amazing graphics. The ultimate original 3D platform game!

{"words": "What I must first say is that this game is incredibly easy, and no, I am not an adult. I am 13 years old, and I got this when I was 12. The levels of the first world, Artisans, are super easy with a very easy boss. It's harder to GET TO the boss than it is to beat it. The levels just seem to keep getting just a tad bit harder, but nothing significant. The hardest boss is the boss of the second level and he isn't very hard either. Gnasty Gnorc is a surprisingly easy boss, once you figure out how to toast him. What makes this game annoying is that there is so much treasure, spread out into so many different places, that you will just rip your hair out in some of the levels trying to get it. But there are some pros. This game is a little bit long making for long lasting entertainment. The game also has great graphics with a frame rate that never slows down, and because between screens, the game is counting treasure, so it's like there's never a single load time. Also, some of the enemies are pretty funny, like in one level, if you do the right thing at the right time, the enemy will actually MOON you, and it's hilarious to see. Also, the controls are simple enough for anyone to figure out making for not much trouble otherwise. Some points of the game are hard like recovering stolen eggs from the theives, but besides that, this is an easy game that I would recommend to anyone below teenage age. The only reason I gave this game three stars was because I know most people like a good challenge, but it wouldn't be fair to give it four just because I personally like an easy game. Still good though.", "label": "bad review"}

{"words": "This game was my introduction to the Resident Evil franchise and the survival horror genre, so it means a lot to me. I don't rate games or movies based on nostalgia, because let's be honest: some things just don't age well in the test of time and lose their effect that may have been once powerful in one's childhood. However, I must say: this still stands out as the best zombie horror game ever made. Best survival horror game ever made? That could be debatable with other strong contenders such as Silent Hill 2 and Dead Space 1. However, as far as zombie/mutated creatures games go, this stands on top. It has numerous jump scares and a great creepy atmosphere that leaves you tense while exploring the abandoned Raccoon City police department.\n\nResident Evil 2 introduces Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield, who would go on to star in future hit installments Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil Code: Veronica (respectively speaking). Leon is a rookie cop in Raccoon City and meets up with Claire during an infestation of zombies and other monsters in the small town that is on the brink of destruction. Together, they must get out and survive while Claire is focusing on finding her brother, Chris Redfield. It's a simple plot, simple premise. The gameplay might feel stiff to those accustomed to the control scheme of games such as Resident Evil 4 and 5, but trust me: if you give it time, you will find it fun and rewarding after a short while.\n\nPersonally, I prefer this game over RE4 or RE5 any day. The horror element is strong in this title, not action-oriented like those other two games. The storyline and characters are excellent and well-done. For Leon's storyline, we see interaction and character development between him and the mysterious Ada Wong; for Claire, it's between her and the lost girl Sherry Birkin. The voice acting and writing for these characters are all done so well, which makes the game ahead of its time as corny voice acting was prevalent in most video games when this was released.\n\nResident Evil 2 offers a lot of replay value. There are hidden items and other goodies you may not see during your first run, and I highly recommend trying both possible scenarios (Leon A/Claire B and Claire A/Leon B) for the game before moving onto other games in the series. There are also secret game modes and weapons to unlock in this game.\n\nOverall, there is a lot to do in terms of gameplay for Resident Evil 2 and it's one of the best video games ever made, hands down. If you've had the misfortune of never playing this game before, then don't waste any more time: play this, now! It's fun, it's scary and it's got great drama in its storyline.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "The series of Resident Evil continues with its sequel Resident Evil 2 on PlayStation released in 1998 and developed by Capcom once again. It takes place in Raccoon City which is the closest residence of the mansion from the first game. This time, the entire city has been transformed into zombies from the outbreak of the T-virus created by Umbrella. You get to play as two characters: Leon S. Kennedy (disc one) who is a Raccoon City Police Officer on his first day of the job and Claire Redfield (disc two) who came into town to search for her missing brother Chris Redfield who was one of the main characters in the first Resident Evil game. Both characters get their own set of weapons and storylines, but it doesnt matter what order you play them in.\n\nThe gameplay features the same basic principles as the first game. You have to solve puzzles, use a limited supply of ammunition, herbs to heal wounds, carry only eight items, and use typewriters to save. Its nice they stuck with the original format of the first game and I wish every Resident Evil game in the series was like this.\n\nYou get some new weapons such as a bowgun, sub machine gun, spark gun and upgrades to Leons handgun, shotgun and magnum. The aiming feels more comfortable and you always seem to be in control of where you shoot. One downside is that auto aim isn't set by default. When you start the game, you have to press Select to get to the options, select the controller settings and set the mode to Type C to turn the auto aim feature on. A nice new addition is that the characters current health can be determined by their posture and movement speed. This makes it easier to tell what condition your player is in and you don't have to go to the inventory screen to find out how much health you have like with the first game. The Item Boxes are back where you can store items you don't need and pick up later, but a new item you can retrieve is the Side Pack which will allow you to carry two more items increasing your total to ten. Both Leon and Claire are joined by a support partner throughout the story. Leon is aided by a woman named Ada Wong who is searching for her boyfriend. Claire is aided by a 12 year old girl named Sherry who was told to go to the police station because of the dangers in Raccoon City. But even the police station is infested with zombies and bio weapons. The enemies in this game are really memorable; there are the lickers who are just terrifying and powerful, especially later in the game. Then theres Mr. X who is like the Terminator, he always comes back to hunt you down.\n\nThe most innovative feature in this game is that there are different scenarios in this game. Say you play as Leon and complete the game as him; well you can then play as Claire in that same scenario to find out the true ending. And you cant play Claires second scenario by popping in the second disc for the first time to play as her, you have to unlock it first. So in total, there are four possible scenarios in this game.\n\nAnother innovative feature is that you get a ranking based on the total amount of time it took to complete a scenario, the number of saves and healing items you use. If you do well, you can unlock some goodies such as infinite ammo for a sub machine gun, gatling gun, rocket launcher, unlock special outfits and three new mini games. The first mini game, you play as Hunk, whose mission is to escape the Raccoon City Police Department with the latest G-Virus created by Umbrella. The second mode is known as Extreme Battle in which you play through the entire map of the game and you have to locate four special bombs to destroy the T-Virus in Umbrellas Lab before it can cause a lot of damage. You get to play as four characters: Leon, Claire, Ada and Claires brother Chris. Each has their own set of weapons and you can adjust a difficulty setting to fight stronger monsters including bosses from the regular game. The third and final game mode is called Tofu and it is the strangest mini game I have ever seen. You play as this giant block of Tofu (Yes, I am dead serious, a giant piece of Tofu) and in terms of the objective its the same as Hunks mission except you play as Tofu, who is only equipped with a combat knife, so it makes this mini game very difficult to complete. Ive completed the mode as Hunk, but never as Tofu. The good news however is that Tofu takes a lot of hits to kill so basically the only way to complete this game is to run. Dont even bother fighting the enemies, the knife in Resident Evil 2 is just extremely weak and isn't worth the time. Still this mode is worth playing just for the amusement factor because Tofu says some funny Japanese phrases whenever he gets hurt. Its funny, even though I cant understand it. It is also pretty difficult to unlock, you have to get an A ranking at least six times to play this mini game. For the Extreme Battle and Hunk, you only need two A rankings.\n\nOne thing I didn't mention yet is that the music is really awesome. It has orchestral themes and even opera themes and it fits the game very well. There were many different versions of this game. There was an updated version on PlayStation called Resident Evil 2: Dual Shock Edition which is the same as the regular game except it supports the PlayStations DualShock controllers analog stick and vibration function. The Extreme Battle Mode I mentioned is exclusive only to the Dual Shock Edition. Theres also a Rookie mode which gives the player a Machine Gun with infinite ammo at the start of the game, but you cant unlock the other mini games playing this difficulty even if you get an A ranking, you have to play Normal mode to unlock them. Another cool thing about the Dual Shock Version is you can use a cheat code to give yourself unlimited ammo. You just go to the control settings, hold R1 and press square repeatedly until the icon turns red. This version was later released on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation 3.\n\nThere were also ports on the PC and Dreamcast with slightly better graphics, higher frame rate and an art gallery. There was even a port on the Game com. It was a s***ty 2D black and white handheld console by Tiger. That port is just pathetic; Im not even going to discuss it. The best port however is the Nintendo 64 version. The sound on the Nintendo 64 version is better than the PlayStations version, it has updated graphics, new costumes, a setting to adjust the violence and blood color, a more responsive aiming control scheme, new files, cheat codes to give you infinite health and ammo and the most interesting feature of all is a randomizer to place items differently during each playthrough so it definitely has more variety. The only thing its missing is the Extreme Battle mini game. But this port is equally as good as the PlayStations version.\n\nAny criticisms I have with this game? Well its hard for me to think of things I don't like about this game, I guess a minor criticism is that you cant skip the in game cut scenes, you couldn't do that in the first game and its a minor annoyance when you already played the game a million times like I did and just want to get through the game. The problem most people have with this game is the beginning. You start the game surrounded by about ten zombies with a slow handgun. The first time playing, you only have a few seconds to figure out the controls until the zombies corner and kill you. It definitely sounds like a terrible idea to start next to the zombies. My strategy is to just run away. Hold square, press up on the d-pad to run and use up-left and up-right to get around the enemies. Once you figure that out, it isn't too hard to get past the zombies and give yourself some breathing room. It did take me a while to figure out the controls but Ive mastered it and you can too. The voice acting in this game is much better than the first Resident Evil, but still nothing too special. Thats about all the criticisms I can think of.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I used to play the s*** out of this game and in my opinion; this is undeniably not only the best Resident Evil game, but the best survival horror game and one of the best PlayStation games I have ever played. This game still manages to be very scary, if you're playing this for the first time, you are guaranteed to be so scared; your heart will burst out your chest. Trust me; I had my jumps even to this day. Its more fun playing this game alone in your room in the dark, with the volume turned up. This makes for a terrifying and memorable experience. I absolutely love this game, its just a masterpiece. Id recommend getting the version from the PlayStation Store to play on the PS3 for only $6, or the regular PlayStation version or the Nintendo 64 version. Those are the best options. The replay value is very high for me and I could play this game at any time. You will admire this game and its by far the best in the entire series.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Resident Evil 2 picks up a little after the original game in the series. The virus that the evil Umbrella corporation has been researching managed to get out into the open, and people have been dropping dead like flies as a result. The story begins when two central characters are separated in a car crash, and both try to survive long enough to work out what on Earth is going on in Racoon City. It sounds like a very basic, even threadbare plot, and to tell the truth, it is. But therein lies the charm of Resident Evil and most all of its sequels. One can go anywhere, do anything, kill anything, and apart from the frustration of winding up with nowhere to go at times, the game will not penalise the player for it. In this day and age where racing simulators are nothing more than knowing which lever to jerk when, it makes for a nice change.\n\nOf course, as the main influence makes clear, the player soon finds themselves battling with undead citizens (and worse) throughout the course of the game. Those who like to kill everything in sight may find the going a little tough, as the game rewards the player for knowing what to kill and when. A zombie in a wide, open area does not require immediate shooting, but a licker in a confined space should be put down as quickly and quietly as possible. Knowing the difference can literally decide whether you complete this game or not. But if one does get into a situation where they are low on ammunition and are not sure where they are meant to go, they can simply keep exploring until a solution presents itself. Such is the quality of the artwork on offer that it takes a while for this to become boring.\n\nOne criticism of the game that is perfectly valid is that the zombie models only seem to have four varieties. Occasionally, different types will appear if certain conditions are met, such as not picking up any items during the trip to the police station, but for the most part, it is a rather generic bunch. Another problem is the save point system, which can make the quest seem repetitive at times if resumed. However, the fun of the game truly lies in revealing threads of the plot, which, while occasionally clich, is put together like an elegant series of Chinese boxes. Questions are raised constantly, and half the fun is in finding the answers. In a complete contrast to the second feature film, the motions and attacks of the enemy are completely consistent, and even make sense from a biological point of view. One other criticism I have that applies to all of the Resident Evil games I have played to date is that in so-called tense moments, when a mass-attack by zombies or other terrors begins, one can often tell when they have completely beaten off their opposition by when the background music calms down. Although I am not entirely sure that is a bad thing.\n\nThe replay value of the game is heightened by the ability to complete one character's quest, save the results, and use them on the other's. What one does in one game directly affects what happens in the other. Decisions such as who should take the submachine gun, for example, are of great importance in the game, as are such things as opening doors or killing certain major enemies. Getting into the underground lab towards the end of the game is quite a chilling moment, too. Notwithstanding the fight that takes place on the way down, this deserted research lab is enough to put the wind up any a dedicated viewer of horror films. A contrast, as it were, to the godawful second film adaptation.\n\nIf I were giving Resident Evil 2 a score, it would be ten out of ten. Sure, it is looking old considering it was originally released on the PlayStation and Dreamcast, but unlike the vast majority of games, it has the ability to withstand the test of time. It is well worth hunting around the stores that specialise in second-hand or liquidated stock for.", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Few games have endured in my collection like Resident Evil 2. The graphics are old, dated, and painful in the year 2011 where Dead Island and Dead Rising 2 are the dominant Zombie games. But it looks well enough to play for days and months on end. The gameplay is clunky and clumsy, but it is a horror game designed to make you feel inadequate and somewhat unprepared for the adventure you are thrown into. The story is Sci-Fi Originals bad and in hard to understand, but that was what they were going for.\n\nHonestly, everything about the game should not work. It does alot wrong, but it does MORE right. Yes, it all meshes together into a really good game. Yes, in a few years it will be a painful to play as, say, Pitfall for the Atari, but even when it is thriteen years old it is still F-U-N to play.\n\nI played it non-stop when I had my PS1, continued to play it with my PS2, and even now, after I got an Xbox 360 and play other games, I still plug up my PS2 and play some RE2 once and awhile. Yes, I can see the blocky graphics, bad audio, and ect, but I LOVE this game. It's my favorite of all time.

{"words": "What can be said about Resident Evil 2 that hasn't already been said already? Well, a lot of people have said a lot of things about this game, so this is just my personal experience about this game.\n\nWhen Capcom announced Resident Evil 2 after the first one was a success, they announced it to be released in 1997, but 90% of the way through Capcom decided to scrap that project and start over (this would become normal for Capcom throughout the years of Resident Evil history), but what people saw at E3 was a totally different game. That version is called by the fans Resident Evil 1.5 and fans have been pleading with Capcom for it's release...\n\nWith Resident Evil 1.5, you had Leon, but you also had another character that was scrapped named Eliza Walker. Eliza was supposed to be a University student in Raccoon City, she loved motorcycles and she was eventually turned into Claire Redfield. The reason they scrapped this version is because it played too much like the original and they felt that they wanted to do something different since they felt that they had to surpass the original game.\n\nAlso, what I find interesting is that the first person you encounter in Leon's quest, Marvin, he was supposed to come with you in the scrapped version instead of turning into a zombie.\n\nAgain, sorry for the history lesson, so onto the review:\n\nIt was 1998, I was 14 years old and I was spending the night at a friend's house, and he said \"You wanna play Resident Evil 2?\" We popped in Leon's quest in and BAM! The rest is history.\n\nWhat made this game the best in the series? Well, it took what was good about the first game and multiplied it many times over adding two new characters to the Resident Evil Universe: Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie R.P.D. cop fresh out of the academy and is reporting for duty.\n\nClaire Redfield (who is Chris's younger sister from the first Resident Evil game) who comes to Raccoon City looking for her brother.\n\nEverything seems out of place at first, but once you see the zombies come after them, Leon and Claire get separated and now it is a MAD rush to the police station.\n\nOnce you get there (either as Leon or Claire), you start to unravel a story that is just completely amazing. If you play as Leon, you meet up with Ada who is looking for her boyfriend John and a newspaper reporter named Robert. As Claire, you met up with a little girl named Sherry, a scientist named Annette (who is Sherry's mother), and the police chief Brian Irons.\n\nAs you get deeper into the story as either character, you soon find out about the sub-characters and what their motives are; especially the seductive Ada. Ada, it turns out is looking for the G-Virus (which is the younger brother of the T-Virus, but also, much deadlier in making the zombies and monsters deadlier than they actually are), although she doesn't say who she works for until it is mentioned in Wesker's Report who Ada was working for; it turns out that she was working for Wesker. Toward the end in Leon's quest, she falls to her \"death\", but very much like Wesker, she keeps on coming back like a phoenix rising from the ashes (she comes back and help's Leon find the President's daughter in Resident Evil 4).\n\nAnnette (in Claire's quest) is actually trying to stop Ada from getting the G-Virus and makes the assumption that Claire is after her husband's work (William Birken is actually the father of the G-Virus, which after a raid he is shot and he injects the G-Virus into himself and basically becomes a menace for both characters).\n\nSherry get's infected with the G-Virus and Claire makes the only own cure for the virus...\n\nAlso in Claire's quest, Umbrella drops what looks like a bomb with legs in the police station and it turns out that they dropped another tyrant that bothers Claire through the game with the name Mr. X; putting Mr. X down only bought you time, nothing else. Most players decided not to play Claire's quest because of Mr. X...and yes I will admit that he could be a pain because very much like Nemesis in the third game, he came in the most uneasiest moments, except with this game, loading doors saved you...not so much in the third game.\n\nThere were new monsters in this game; like the big alligator in the sewers, the lickers, plant zombies that spat venom at you, and of course (unlike in the first game), you now have women zombies.\n\nAlso, what makes a RE game an RE game? Two words: Rocket Launcher. If you beat the game in under three hours, you can choose either a gatling gun or a rocket launcher with infinite ammo which gave you even more reason to mow the zombies down one last time.\n\nThere are also mini-games: The 4th Survivor which you took control of Hunk where you have to grab the G-Virus and make a mad dash to the end, and also Tofu Survivor which is pretty much like The 4th Survivor, except you only have a knife to fight the zombies, but also it also let us know that at least the developers have a sense of humor.\n\nWith a fresh story-line (at the time), new monsters, and just about everything that makes the early RE games good...If you haven't played it, it is worth checking it out.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis game has been ported to many systems, but it has never been remade. There are fans that would LOVE to see this game remade (myself included) with cleaner graphics, in HD, and a couple of tweaks; one of them being you can move in a 360 position with a weapon, and if you get trapped by a zombie, you can get out of the way before he/she starts to enjoy their manwich.\n\nHappy Gaming!", "label": "good review"}

Resident Evil 2 improved upon the original in many ways. The voice is a little better though it still has moments of cheese.

{"words": "I see myself as a guru of Survival Horror games, I like'em and I like what they make me feel. Now let's get on with my review for Resident Evil 2.\n\nI have to first mention that I did not and will not buy Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 3 for Gamecube... unlike Resident Evil Remake they have nothing new to offer me or you... which is sad after seeing what they did and what improvement remake was to the original Resident Evil. So let's just keep this review centered around the Original Resident Evil 2 game for PSX 1.\n\nComparing RE 2 to RE or RE Director's Cut is like comparing Raw Horsemeat to a young Stallion. Resident Evil 2 had better graphics and sound by far, not to mention the fact that it was on a bigger bolder scale than Resident Evil. Simple bottom line folks is that if your looking for a GOOD Survival Horror game... pick this one up.\n\nI had no real gripes towards the game and I felt that the DEVs of the game did everything in the better interest for the Resident Evil genre. As you can see by the score that I gave this game, I liked it and I truly think you'd like it aswell.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "My first experience with the Resident Evil series was with Code: Veronica X.  I was severely disappointed overall with it, and from what I've read, the whole series is the same, so I had little to no faith in it.  I didn't feel the need whatsoever to play the other games, and openly spoke out against the series, even though I only played one game.  But, after playing Resident Evil 4, I got intrigued by the story, so I decided to try out Resident Evil 1-3.  I thought, \"There's no way they can be worse than Code: Veronica, so why not?\"  And good god... was I right.\n\nAlthough the first RE was little more than a big laughable joke (thanks to the ridiculously horrible voice acting that makes what you find in Code: Veronica X look like an Oscar-winning performance), that wasn't really scary at all until the hunters came into the picture, the second iteration really blew me away.  Anybody who has known me for more than two seconds knows I don't care at all about graphics in a videogame, so I'm not going to say anything about them because it is irrelevant (which is why I'm not a GameCube or Xbox fan).  The gameplay is very good for a survival horror - there is plenty of puzzle solving, adventure, exploration, and combat to keep the interest level up.  That's what I like about survival horror: it's not just about fighting to stay alive, but it is also about exploring and solving puzzles to unravel the plot and make sense out of mysterious circumstances.  And, while Resident Evil 2 isn't anywhere near as scary or intricate in story as the Silent Hill series, it is still a top-notch game to play for any fan of the genre, and I highly recommend it.  The first one you can play on your own; I just played it because I wanted to know what Wesker did to get Chris so ticked off with him, and vice versa.  The reason the title of my review is \"I was wrong...\" is because I really was wrong in assuming that the Resident Evil series was a bunch of bunk and no worth anyone's time.  So, I apologize for being a presumptuous jerk.\n\nBut, there is one issue I just can't stop from addressing: the controversy over the control scheme.  Now, I won't go into one of my trademark rants insulting everybody, but I will state my thoughts from an objective point of view.  The reason survival horror games have such awkward controls is because the game developers wanted it that way.  This is a genre for puzzle solving, plotlines, exploration, and thought, not just about shooting things.  They made the controls this way to render it, in a way, a sort of \"anti-action\" type of game genre.  Still, though, once you get used to the controls, like me, you will have no trouble blasting zombies torsos in two soon enough.\n\nAnother thing that is cool about this game is the zombies and their... \"creative\" death sequences (okay, so maybe they die a second time, but this time for good).  Naturally, you can blow their heads off, but even more possibilities await your execution.  Sometimes, you can fire at them and their arm will be severed by your bullets, or with a shotgun you can shoot them at the base of their spine and they will be blasted in half, the upper section of their body crawling on the ground with its arms alone to try and bite you.  When you upgrade your shotgun later on, you can actually blow their chest in half!  And, with a rocket launcher, if you fire at them square in their torso, their arms, head, and a good portion of their upper body will be gone.  If you hit them to the right side, most of said side will be gone, as will their head and respective arm, yet their left arm will still be attached.  Pretty cool, huh?  Code: Veronica X didn't have anything like that, which is rather too bad.\n\nThe only problem I had with this game, and it really isn't a problem with the game itself, is that it really made me shake my head at Code: Veronica X.  It almost seems as if Capcom had taken a huge step backward in their videogame-making abilities.  Heck, even the first Resident Evil is better than REC:VX.  For example, in the first one, the hunters had narrow, sharp, reptilian eyes, rows of razor-sharp teeth that protruded from their mouths, and they looked pretty scary, but in Code: Veronica, they didn't have such teeth (it almost looked like they didn't have any at all), and they also had small, beady eyes, making them more of a joke than an intimidating enemy.\n\nYet another good part about this game is the Titan.  I must say, he is really one heck of a bad guy.  But, of course, he's nowhere near as bad*ss as the Nemesis or as terrifying as Pyramid Head.  But he's cool nonetheless.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if you like survival horror games, then I suggest you try this one out.  But don't expect it to be better than Silent Hill, if you're a fan of that series (just as a side note).", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "Now THIS is how you're supposed to enjoy blowing through a bloody, violent game!  Blood squirting from moaning zombie bodies.  It's so strange and relaxing to experience this.  I know you will laugh at what I am about to tell you, but I never bothered with this game when it first came out.  Yeah, I know, I lost many friends because of this.  I ignored this game in 1998, and my level of coolness went right down the tubes.  I had to fail math and pretend to smoke cigars to fit back in with my classmates again.\n\nChildren shouldn't play this game.  If you think it's ok for children to see the two main characters in this game shoot and fry their way through the police station then you might not be a reasonable person.  Yes that's right: you can walk through a police station in this game.  If in real life you have a problem with the way cops sit in a field and watch over you to make sure you have your seat belt on (and not one of those cases where you pretend to put the seat belt on until the cop is out of view and then take it off again) you now have a place to take out your frustrations- Resident Evil 2.\n\nThe weapons in this game are realistically cool.  I like pulling out the magnum and shooting zombies in the head and watching their heads blow to pieces.  Don't try this at home, but do try this on your Playstation.  The magnum doesn't make much noise so you wouldn't think it'd be such a bad-ass weapon, but you can shoot at the head of a zombie and watch his head quietly blow to smithereens.  You know you shouldn't do that in real life though, right?  You'd go to jail for a very long time.  And if you tried to explain to the police that you were shooting at zombies, you'd only get laughed at by the entire court room.  Use your head.\n\nIf this game doesn't satisfy your sick animal-like needs, then try looking for the fire blaster thing.  You can cook zombies with this.  It's near the end of the game hidden in a locker.  Go near the locker and press the X button, and it will open and you will say \"sweet\".\n\nIn this game you have two CD's.  One CD is for the Leon adventure, and the other CD is for the Claire adventure.  You can choose to start the game with either Leon or Claire.  To do the game completely you have to beat the game twice with Leon and twice with Claire.  I've only ever played this game on easy and I had a blast.  I'm sure on normal it's quite harder, maybe so hard you can't think straight and become dumb.  Of course you aren't dumb, it's just that video games can confuse you sometimes.\n\nMan I'm tired.  But I'm never too tired to take a couple hours from my easy-going day and blasting my way through this super cool game.  The only downside is that you can't skip the cutscenes.  That's fine at first, when you want to listen closely to the story (even though I didn't) but after a while you really wish Capcom would have put a skip button on this thing.\n\nStill, great game.  It's old, but please don't be one of those people who thinks that just because something is old it's not good.  I've been around people who think like that and they just ain't cool.  Sure, these people get all the girls and all the friends, but what else?  What's \"in\" sucks, and what's old is cool.  You think I'm wrong?  Good for you.

{"words": "Resident Evil 2 was one of the best Psx games back in the mid 90's as it had exclusive rights to Sony.  The game was the sequal to one of the best Survival Horror game ever.  Does this do better then its prediseccor?...YES.  OH HELL YES.  The game is a solid good game.  The story line is really entertaining but it was more of a sci fi then a horror story.  I won't spoil the story for you but the game is 2 discs and you control 2 characters(serpartly) in the game.  One is a cop named Leon Kennedy and the other is female after her missing brother Chris(who was in RE1)and the two end up meeting eachother and the rest you can figure out..\n\nI really enjoyed this game, it was fantastic.  I loved the graphics for this game it was just \"wow\".  The game is pretty short if you play only one half of the character you play as.  They both have 2 parts(kina).  Once you complete that characters game it opens up the second of half of the other character.  The game is fairly lenghy if you play the WHOLE game.  The game has some great twists that'll keep you up all night.  Lemmi make it easier for you...Resident Evil 2 was one of the coolest Playstation games ever.  It had an awesome story line, sweet graphics and decent dialoug.  It is also spooky in the scare factor especially when you see something crawl around a window in the beggining of the game.  In other words the game is awesome and scary.\n\nThe graphics for that time were just great and comparable to Metal Gear Solid.  The character model for Leon and Clair was amazing and the zombies looked even more creepy then before, not to mention the bloody gore in this game....jeez.  Capcom did a great job making the graphics.  kudose..\n\nThe gameplay is what really made me love this game.  Gun n' down zombies and solving puzzle...my type of game baby.  The Puzzle are not that hard but they are pretty cool.  The gameplay never gets boring and the boss fights are really cool.  The gameplay may turn some off in the beggining.  Mainly cause it's just runing away from zombies but later on that will change...trust me..\n\nThe sound is incredible!  The zombies sound so realistic and the music for the boss fights are magnifecent(my spelling sucks I know).  The sound it self deserves a one star...\n\nWhat turned me off was the \"kina cheezy sci fi\" story.  It didn't have the same spooky feeling Resident Evil 1 had in story...which causes me to take off one star...Well yeah it was a stupid move just for that but hey that's my opinion...\n\nThe games has amazing graphics, great sound, lots of awesome gameplay and is one of my favorite video game series.  Not only that it may possibly be the best in the series if not then It's 3.\n\nThis game deserves a\n\n4.8 out 5....\n\nResident Evil series is a superb series and anyone who loves survival horror will love it.  I personaly think it's one of the best gaming series out but I don't have ALL the resident Evil games.. The only ones I have are the one that go with the story like the ones I have are\n\nAnd for any newbie out there who is trying to get into the series, if you have a gamecube and get the remake of the original and start with that...then 2, 3 then Resident Evil zero which is a really enjoyable Resident Evil game...Well\n\nLates..", "label": "good review"}

{"words": "I rented this game when it first game out, I was scared out of my mind. Everything made me jump, now I have sort of gotten over that, I am 15 and although the music and sound(zombie moaning and feet stepping) creates this scary atmosphere, it is not THAT scary. Most of you can handle it.\nAnyways, I needed a strategy guide for some of it. It just, it just is unrealistic. Yea to put out a fire you need a crank in a cabin? Why was the crank removed in the first place. \"We need to make it so if there is a fire of some sort, this hose we have hooked up, will release some water.\" Yea they happened to put a handy dandy hose thingy in the ceiling, so just incase a helicopter crashed under it, or there was a mass fire under it, the hose would put it out. Yea right. Ok you need a cord just to close some shutters so zombies won't attack you? If the police were fighting, they should of closed these shutters beforehand, so less zombies came in. Instead, they decided to put the cord in an office about a mile away. Wanna get into that room? You need the crest and key and plugs buddy! How did the police actually get around this police station.\nMoving off of that, the game is alright. You have alot of ammo on easy, although I fear I will run out alot of the time, I usually find a pack or 2 to keep me going. The zombies themselves can take quite alot, like 5 hits to kill them. However once you get the pistol modification for Leon, they become a whole lot easier. The story is nice. 2 people trying to escape a city full of undead living thingy creatures and such. Theres alot of other characters though, you aren't the last 2 humans alive in the city. The game even though was known to have a sequel considering tremendous profits, finishes great. It starts randomly, but then ends where it should. It succeeds in making a good game. Good story, some action, you get to kill some of those evil zombies, and good package.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "Capcom followed up the surprise success of the original Resident Evil with this blockbuster smash in 1998.  Resident Evil 2 had everything the original had plus tons more; bigger more detailed environments, weirder puzzles, more suspense, more blood and gore, and a compelling story that kept the gamer on the edge of their seat.  In this installment you play as rookie cop Leon Kennedy or Claire Refield: the sister of Chris from the first game.  Instead of a secluded mansion like the first game, this time all of Raccoon City has been infected by Umbrella's virus and you have to wade through an assortment of flesh eating zombies, mutated dogs, hunters, a new monster called the Licker (whose introduction in the game is one of the most unforgettable parts in any video game), and some unbelieveably grotesque beasts who will stop at nothing until your dead.  Resident Evil 2 was an instant smash hit upon it's release and has since been regarded as a classic video game and an essential play for any gamer.  Since then, the game has been re-released on other systems such as the Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, and most recently the Gamecube; so now gamers of any generation can play one of the most addicting and innovative games of all time.", "label": "good review"}
{"words": "There's a lot of hype surrounding the Resident Evil series of games. They're on most systems, there are books, and even a movie. The story is a good one, but I found the game to not be so great. Graphics are alright, the sound is bad though. And game play is horrible. Trying to move around is difficult and can be confusing, especially when you're under attack and things are chaotic. The characters move unlike most games. You don't go in the direction of the D-pad, rather you turn with right and left direction and move with a button. It was poorly designed. But since the Playstation 2 is out, and better games as well as more Resident Evil, there's no reason to pick up this game anymore. The 2-disc set here is one adventure with a male character and another with a female. The game is involved, just not as much fun as it shoud be", "label": "bad review"}
{"words": "Beat the first yet? If you have, then jump right ahead to the second masterpiece in the series.\nIt's fun, it's scary, and it is one hell of a ride. Ultimatley, Resident Evil 2 will give some nightmares. If the first one scared you, get ready to be terrified again!", "label": "good review"}
